The new ability to download tracks and playlists to my phone is incredible!\n\nThe only thing that could make it better would be to be able to stream the current song in Clementine to my phone, playing it through my phone.  This way I could, for example, play music through my wifi network to a stereo system in a different room, far from my computer where Clementine is.  Since I can't fit that much music on my phone, this would be really handy.\n\nThere's a request on the Clementine issue tracker to stream to Icecast servers, but since this app can already download songs from Clementine, all it really needs to do is download the current track and play it on the phone, then delete it.  Maybe it could even cache it in RAM instead of writing it to /sdcard.\n\nThanks for this app and making Clementine even better!\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/clementine-remote-android/issues/detail?id=20_\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/issues/20/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/issues/2", "title": "Could Not Reach Host", "body": "_From [sg2chibi...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/115200288686560071837/) on March 02, 2013 21:29:24_\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Entering my IP and attempting to connect What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Expected: the remote to connect. Instead: a message that it cannot reach host. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Latest Clementine build, 32-bit, Fedora 18. App downloaded from Google Play. Please provide any additional information below. I've gone and updated my version of Clementine from the stable to latest (lots of nice new features), got the app installed on my phone, the remote is enabled and the port is 5500 on both my computer as well as in the app's settings...but when I enter my IP address ( http://www.whatismyip.com/ ), the app tells me it cannot connect to the host. My computer is on and playing music at this very moment, but the app won't connect to it.

Rules though can be applied that customise who can/cannot gain access e.g. Clementine Remote on Android.\n\nI used the following terminal command to solve my access problem : 'sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24' which allows all devices on my home (sub) network to access my Linux machine and thus Clementine.\n\nI can highly recommend the following two web pages from which I gleaned this and other relevant info: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Gufw - whereby a Gui facility can be used https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW - whereby terminal commands may be used\n\nHope this may help others :)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/issues/comments/29980180/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/issues/comments/29980183", "body": "_From [asfa...@googlemail.com](https://code.google.com/u/103112240225484944657/) on November 17, 2013 11:14:15_\n\nThanks for your detailed input! :-)\nI think it will be useful for other users, too.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/issues/comments/29980183/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/issues/comments/29980186", "body": "_From [asfa...@googlemail.com](https://code.google.com/u/103112240225484944657/) on March 10, 2013 11:09:56_\n\nHm, seems to be a Samsung specific bug.

It has the potential to be a simple yet powerful remote application. :)\n\nHere are a few ideas how the playlist handling could be improved.\n- I second the request to have a \"Clear playlist\" button ([see Issue 75](https://github.com/clementine-player/Android-Remote/issues/75))\n- Deleting multiple songs from a playlist takes an awful long time, because the user has to \"long touch\" every song and delete it. So a multi-selection mode (similar to the one in the standard Android gallery app) would be nice. It could be activated from a menu in the top right corner.\n- Simple \"swipe-to-delete-a-song-from-the-playlist\" mode (maybe with an undo functionality)\n- Also easy re-arrangement of songs in the playlist would be nice (multi-selection as a bonus)\n- layout improvements: smaller track number, overall less padding\n- option to activate smart playlist modes (e.g. 50 random tracks, dynamic random mix, etc.)\n- load/save a playlist from your Android device\n- synchronize playlists with Clementine desktop application\n\nThe list might need to be split up into individual tasks, I just did not want to spam the issue list.\nI will try to find time to help with some of the suggested tasks.\n", "reactions": {"url":

When using the framework provided Activity class the namespace for `showAsAction` has to be `android`, not `app`. That was a mistake on my end. #124\nThe reason I replaced it was that it got flagged as an error by Lint, and Android Studio was also displaying it as an error (red squiggly line). I did some further investigation, and it appears that if you include appcompat-v7, it assumes you're using the support variants of the classes. appcompat-v7 is needed for `ActionBarDrawerToggle`. The mix of support and non-support versions for Activity/ActionBar related classes likely led to the confusion of Lint/Android Studio, and is also the reason for the unusual rendering of the new drawer indicator on the old holo-style action bar. See #125 for a pull request that updates the action bar and also fixes the problem with the hidden items.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/comments/10752785/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "review_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/pulls/comments/26023957", "body": "Yes, this is needed, the twofortyfouram library is not available from `jcenter()`\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/pulls/comments/26023957/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/pulls/comments/26532217", "body": "Also, member variables in Android should be prefixed with `m`, like in the line above (`mSelAlbum`) :)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/pulls/comments/26532217/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/pulls/comments/26532433", "body": "Should the value of `IDX_YEAR` be a `7`?

But I figured out something here:\n- my office PC used the WEP password to connect to the network.\n- my own PC (home) used the WPA2/WPA-PSK password.\n\nIs there related to those password used?\nIf there is, is it solvable (may there'll be future update) for next Clementine release?\n\nThanks and regards.\n:)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/issues/comments/40040517/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "FletcherD": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clementine-player/Android-Remote/issues/comments/42485613", "body": "Wow, thanks for the quick fix!
