All of these browsers support `woff`, thus making `eot` obsolete and redundant.\r\n- the `svg` font format was abandoned when it become more than apparent it that it was wildly unsuitable for encoding fonts, to the point where the official SVG specifically *removed* the chapter on font-related markup, marking it as out-of-spec markup. SVG-compliant browsers have since removed support for it (because it's no longer part of the spec) and the only browser that still officially supports `svg` fonts also supports `woff`, making `svg` also both obsolete and redundant.\r\n- the `ttf` and `otf` formats, as full-table, uncompressed system fonts, are also not necessary: browsers that support these formats also support `woff`, and should always prefer to load the `woff` resource if one is available. The only exception could be said to be Android 2.x through 4.2.x, but these versions have terrible web font support even when using `ttf` and are on the same level of \"you're on your own\" when it comes to webfonts as we used to be when we tried to make modern CSS work on IE6, 7, and 8. `ttf` and `otf` also don't enjoy the benefit of compression that `woff` comes with.\r\n\r\nSo for modern bootstrap, really the only formats needed are `woff` and `woff2`, with the latter of course being preferred because it has better compression for faster delivery over the wire.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/1109/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "JoshMoreno": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/1105", "title": "Breadcrumb variable interpolation breaking sourcemaps", "body": "For reference - https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/919\r\n\r\nI think the above issue has to be reopened. Sorry if I should be posting there, kinda new to github and its issue/bug tracking.\r\n\r\nSo from what I can tell, there used to be an issue with how libsass compiled the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontent: \"#{$breadcrumb-separator}\\00a0\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it got changed to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$nbsp: \"\\00a0\";\r\ncontent: \"#{$breadcrumb-separator}#{$nbsp}\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now that leads to it getting compiled to:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontent: \"/ \";\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd on top of that if the libsass output style is set to `compressed` it causes source maps to be inaccurate. The other output styles are fine though. I submitted an issue over there - https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/2319\r\n\r\n# Proposition\r\n\r\nBecause this whole variable interpolation stuff is pretty unreliable and inconsistent across recent versions of libsass, I propose to just hardcode the value. So...\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontent: \"/\\00a0\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat way it will work for people using slightly older versions of libsass and also for people using the recent version(s). And though we won't have a simple variable to change/override, it's super easy to override the old fashion way. For example\r\n\r\n```\r\n.breadcrumb>li+li:before {\r\n    content: \"\\003e\\00a0\"; // for a \">\" instead of a \"/\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd much rather have minified css and source maps than a variable for breadcrumbs. I know, as a work around, I could use a separate css minifier, but they add nearly one second to compile time. Libsass is fast and hard to beat and I really like to keep things simple and fast whenever possible.\r\n\r\nThoughts on this?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/1105/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "sinrise": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/1104", "title": "Inconsistent .badge bg colors", "body": "The class `.badge` has a background-color of #777777, but a `.badge` inside a `.panel-default > .panel-heading` has a bg color of #333333. `.badge` bg color is defined in _variables.scss and _panels.scss.

This was a great improvement for us as it allowed us to pull more dependencies in through npm.\n\nWe have a sass library that works both in Rails's asset pipeline and in other ecosystems. The eyeglass import having a different name in Eyeglass unfortunately makes us choose between only supporting building through eyeglass, or not having eyeglass support and having everything else work.\n\nFor example, in Rails:\n\n``` scss\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n```\n\nBut in eyeglass:\n\n``` scss\n@import \"bootstrap-sass/bootstrap\";\n```\n\nIf you look at the README in its current state you can see how consistent it is until you get down to the Eyeglass section.\n\nThis could be fixed by adding a `name` field to the `eyeglass` section package.json for `bootstrap-sass`:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"name\": \"bootstrap-sass\",\n  \"version\": \"1.1.0\",\n  \"eyeglass\": {\n    \"name\": \"bootstrap\",\n    \"needs\": \"^0.6.7\",\n    \"exports\": \"eyeglass-exports.js\"\n  }\n```\n\nFor consistency, I think it would be great if you could `@import \"bootstrap\"` in any ecosystem and have it work.\n\nThis would be a breaking change for anybody currently using eyeglass, but an easy fix to implement (change your import statements to \"@import bootstrap\").\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/1085/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "pr0jectile": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/1075", "title": "Sass @import \"bootstrap-compass\" + @import \"bootstrap\" issue using Compass.", "body": "I've created a new project using `compass create <my-project-name> -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap` and when I open styles.scss I see the following code: \n\n```\n// Import Bootstrap Compass integration\n@import \"bootstrap-compass\";\n\n// Import custom Bootstrap variables\n@import \"bootstrap-variables\";\n\n// Import Bootstrap for Sass\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n```\n\nNow I am using PHPStorm and `@import \"bootstrap-compass\";` and `@import \"bootstrap\";` are showing up as red lines.
