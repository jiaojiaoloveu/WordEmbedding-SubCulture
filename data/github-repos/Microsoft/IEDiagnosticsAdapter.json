We then have JavaScript running on the page (the IEWebKitImpl project) that receives the command, does appropriate things, and then sends a response back.\nTo get the styles pane working, I\u2019m guessing that we need to implement DOM.getAttributes\nThe Basic workflow that I\u2019m using is as follows\n1. Debug the chrome dev tools to see how the Chrome dev tools respond to a command.**\n2. Implement a handler in JavaScript that is injected onto the page. In this case add a function GetAttributes in Dom.ts that gets the node specified using DOMHandler::_mapUidToNode and reads the relevant properties from the node\n3. Format a response that mimics the response chrome gives as closely as possible. Set this on the processedResult object, and then browserHandler.postResponse will send it back to the chrome dev tools.\n\nHopefully this it helpful for getting you started!\n\n*\\* To debug the chrome dev tools with the chrome dev tools, follow these steps\n1. Launch chrome from the command prompt with the flag \"--remote-debugging-port=9222\". For example run \u201cC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application>chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222\u201d\n2. Navigate to a website\n3. Open another chrome tab, and navigate to localhost:9222, select the site you navigated to in step 2\n4. Hit f12 to debug the chrome dev tools with the chrome dev tools.\n5. Under the network inspector, you should see a line that looks like a GUID. Select this to see all of the commands that the dev tools are sending to the page and all of the responses. You may need to refresh the dev tools that are pointed at the page to see network traffic\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/96804366/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/97588194", "body": "Update: We have decided that we want to get the core DOM and Console functionality implemented before we go back to working on stability issues.

Two follow-up questions:\n1. I think I can debug the js scripts injected in the browser thread this way. Is there a way to debug the debugger.js that's injected into the debugger thread?\n2. It seems to me that once I hit a breakpoint in the cpp code in Proxy or DebuggerCore, then I can no longer debug js scripts. Is there a way to get around that?\nThanks again for your pointers.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/106658300/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "auchenberg": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/108587555", "body": "Just pitching in here: Why don't make it as available by enabling external connections? \n\nWe as a community, don't know all the tools/solutions yet, and by binding on 0.0.0.0 you don't limit the existing use-cases supported, but expand them.\n\n(said in the context of me awaiting #27 to be fixed)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/108587555/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/109176432", "body": "I just had a look at the source, and it seems like you are starting Chrome with remote debugging enabled in order to serve the front-end, right?\n\nThat's strictly not needed, as Chrome has a internal URL which can be used to open DevTools: `chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools.html?ws=<webSocketUrl>&remoteFrontend=true'`\n\nHowever the drawback is that it's a \"chrome url\", which means you can't redirect to it, for security reasons, so the user would have to copy&paste the URL.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/109176432/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/109176753", "body": "Fixed in #27 \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/109176753/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/113913144", "body": "My C++ isn't the best, but it looks quite good to me :)\n\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/compare/add-JsonVersion\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/113913144/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/116959793", "body": ":+1: Thanks  :bow:!\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/116959793/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/117054776", "body": "This could be related to #40 \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/117054776/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/IEDiagnosticsAdapter/issues/comments/211552540", "body": "Edge Debugging has been added in a fork of this adaptor.
