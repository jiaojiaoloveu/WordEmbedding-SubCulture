We then respond to that bool accordingly.\n\n2nd, It Enumerates the player states to give us a BUFFERING state. We can then use those Enums to clearly differentiate between PAUSED and BUFFERING.\n\n3rd, It makes the timeout longer in souphttpsrc to give the user time to reconnect in the case of a network disconnect.\n\nAnd finally it makes Pithos behave as you would expect during buffering as far as user initiated state changes.

No proxy. Explicit music allowed.\n\nSame issue as this issue was initially having issues with. Pithos will play great for 20 - 60 minutes then randomly it will get to a song and not play. No issues stopping halfway into a song, but not playing the next song in station.\n\nMore details located [on other issue](https://github.com/pithos/pithos/issues/94) starting at [this comment](https://github.com/pithos/pithos/issues/94#issuecomment-243298951)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pithos/pithos/issues/342/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "JSkier21": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pithos/pithos/issues/339", "title": "Notification tray plugin doesn't remember window position when hiding / showing", "body": "I noticed that when I click the pithos icon (Mate 1.12) the window always pops up in the upper left corner, regardless of where it was before hiding it.

I have Pandora One, so I do not get commercials. But I have attached screen shot showing the song Land Down Under by the Avalanches was renamed to Commercial Advertisement by Pandora. Clicking Song Info shows the correct info by opening the Pandora song info page for that song. \n\nThe image attached attempts to show the difference. \n\nSteps I will try later to reproduce:\n1. Suspend (running Ubuntu) while Pithos is running but paused.\n2. Wake up, log in, unpause pithos.\n3. Pithos will stop playing, sometimes in the middle of a song. I am thinking this is related to me using Suspend, and when it stops I change the station, plays normally. (This could be already documented issue, only have searched for commercial related issues before this post.)\n4. In this case I changed the station once, then changed the station almost right away to Avalanches\n5. First song right away shows Commercial Advertisement\n\nAlso, I doubt this should effect anything, but the song in question is only 0:34 seconds long. Closer to a commercial than a full song. \n\nI'm experienced with Python, not so much with Pithos code yet, but I'm open to investigating this further if anyone has hints / direction / ideas. The only plugin im using is Notify. I have the Pandora One box checked. No proxy, no explicit content filter, Audio quality High. \n\n![pithosbugcommercial](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5049234/14405099/d02ea77e-fe54-11e5-973d-b2e5ee118d79.png)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pithos/pithos/issues/289/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "cmadamsgit": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pithos/pithos/issues/260", "title": "Multiple issues with notification area icon under MATE", "body": "Several behaviors of the notification area icon (at least under the MATE desktop) changed in a negative way with Pithos 1.1.2:\n- left-click on the icon used to toggle the window being visible or not, now it just brings up the same context menu as right-click\n- hovering on the icon used to show the current song info, now does nothing\n- using the mouse scroll wheel on the icon used to adjust the application volume up or down (depending on scroll direction); now it adjusts the system volume instead and it always goes up (no matter the scroll direction)\n\nThis is all on Fedora 23.

I don't have much (really, any) data at this point, but would like to work with you to debug this problem.\n\nFairly often it seems, Pithos will finish a song, and then stop playing. It could have been running for a ong time, or for just a few songs. The next song will be buffered, but it won't start, and oddly enough, the play/pause button still shows the pause bars (so there hasn't been a state toggle to paused).\n\nWhen the pause button is pressed, it stays in the \"play state\" (showing double bars) and the song starts, but there is a clicking every second or two. Think \"radio too close to a spark source\" type of clicking. The only way to fix it I've found so far is restarting Pithos.\n\nVery little network traffic at the time, so I don't _think_ that's it. Very low CPU activity too I'm pretty sure, but could be wrong (maybe it spikes so briefly I don't notice it).\n\nThis is Ubuntu (Kubuntu) 14.04. The audio is going through a USB headset. Have not tried to see if this happens with just the system analog speakers.\n\nWhat can I do to help you debug this?\n\nlspci output, for the fun of it\n\n```\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor DRAM Controller (rev 06)\n00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor PCI Express x16 Controller (rev 06)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 06)\n00:03.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor HD Audio Controller (rev 06)\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family USB xHCI (rev 05)\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1 (rev 04)\n00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family USB EHCI #2 (rev 05)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset High Definition Audio Controller (rev 05)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #1 (rev d5)\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #2 (rev d5)\n00:1c.2 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #3 (rev d5)\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port #4 (rev d5)\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family USB EHCI #1 (rev 05)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation HM86 Express LPC Controller (rev 05)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family 6-port SATA Controller 1 [AHCI mode] (rev 05)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller (rev 05)\n03:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.
