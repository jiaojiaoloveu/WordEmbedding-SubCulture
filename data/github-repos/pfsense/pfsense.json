Long standing \"urgh\". The two pages have 3 other functions split between them which are very closely related - (1) view a list of auth servers, (2) select an auth server, and (3) edit auth servers. It seems very unhelpful to have (1) + (3) on the same page (via add/edit buttons) and (2) as a solo control on a different page, so I've put the GUI auth selection dropdown on the same page as the list of auth servers, which works nicely and makes logical sense.  That left nothing on usermanager_settings, which seems reasonable - it only had 2 controls, one related to admin access security and the other to selecting an auth server, neither was related to the user manager itself. Finally for code simplicity, I split **system_authservers.php** into two files, one for the table display and the other for entry editing, creating a new `system_authservers_edit.php` page from the existing code, because that function really is quite long and complex - basically it's exactly how it's done on other pages with a substantial edit page (such as firewall_rules.php + firewall_rules_edit.php).\r\n\r\n**tl;dr summary:**\r\n\r\n- `usermanager_settings.php` removed. There _weren't_ any settings for the user manager itself, it only had 2 controls, and both were very closely tied to other pages (one much more related to admin security but unhelpfully, not kept with other admin security functions, and the other related to how users authenticate rather than any settings of the usermanager). The controls moved with their code intact, one moved to `system->advanced admin`, the other to `system->user manager -> authentication servers`. They look a lot more at home there, and much easier for GUI users.  \r\n\r\n- `system_authservers.php` was very substantial because of all the auth settings for editing an auth server. In that regard it's closer to firewall rules, which have a separate settings page. It basically forked at `head.inc` to output both the main and edit pages. I split it into 2 pages the same way as firewall rules pages and others - a main page (containing the table and \"add\" button\", and an edit page.  This also let me be fairly sure that it wouldn't would cause issues, and kept the PR much simpler, by making it a direct copypaste with only minor changes.\r\n\r\n- I then added the `GUI login auth server selector` code to be above the table on authservers.\r\n\r\n- I deliberately avoided code change to the underlying code for ease of review.  It's basically copy-paste + minor glue. The only changes are as follows:  (1) Minor UI wording improvements on authserver.gui form, to be clearer what the selector is for, see screenshot, (2) Minor enhancements to validity checking on $_POST/$_REQUEST, (3) simplifying the args for the new `authservers_edit.php`:  it doesn't need `?act=new/edit` in its links now, and can be simplified like firewall_rules_edit.php: the presence of a valid `?id=` signifies edit, anything else signifies new. So I simplified that aspect and $act is set based on `id`.  (4) consequential edits to`help.php` + `priv.defs.inc` (because of the new page and removed page), and other user manager subpages (to remove the usermanager_settings tab),\r\n\r\nI don't use LDAP or other auth servers myself which limits checking, but I haven't modified the code knowingly other than peripheral as described, and the redone code looks good here from what I can see.

These need to work over agnostic IPs as well as sometimes restricted to IPv4 or IPv6 by calling code. So util.inc contains a proliferation of comparison functions. \n\nDespite this, we still don't have several comparisons that are often needed (for example, an equivalent to check_subnets_overlap() for testing range overlap, or range v subnet overlap). These are often needed when validating DHCP, VPN and other IP data.\n\nRather than create new functions for each of these, this PR creates a comprehensive but straightforward generic ip comparison function ip_compare() that handles in one go, all comparisons of ip/subnet/range/IPv4/IPv6 that are likely to be needed, and which is fast and efficient.\n\nFeatures:\n-     ip, range or subnet comparison\n-     handles input in string and factored form, so if a subnet is stored as ip/netmask already, or a range stored as start/end, it doesn't need to be converted to string only to convert back\n  -          subnet       '::fe80/64' evaluated same as array('subnet', '::fe80', 64)\n  -         range         '192.168.1.10-192.168.1.19' evaluated same as array('range', '192.168.1.10', '192.168.1.19')\n  -          if it would be useful to handle INT format IPv4 IPs, that's trivial to add.\n-    all common comparators handled (including overlap and inclusion); new ones are trivial to add\n-    easy human-readable and concise code (see below) for easy debugging and review\n-    IP agnostic by default, or restrict to IPv4/IPv6, as needed.\n-    all data validated and bad input detected\n-    no issues expected with x32/x64, uses hex strings for comparisons so same code copes with both IPv4/IPv6, avoiding all INT_SIZE issues and any duplicated code between IPv4/IPv6 handlers.\n- Code is a lot shorter, more 'generic', and easier to review than current approach (which tends to need 2 separate functions for IPv4/v6 and individual review of each for logic errors). The logic is very clean and trivial to enhance if a new data type, data format or comparison is later found to be useful.\n\nIt therefore provides in one function, back-end functionality of all existing ip_more/less_than, ip-in-subnet/range, and subnet/range-overlap/inclusion functions. Also, all input is validated, and IPv4/IPv6 agnostic (or restricted as desired).  So existing functions and high level code can use this as a high-level back end for comparison functions, simplifying use of high level IP functions.\n\nThe function is internally documented so here are examples of use as a back-end to other comparison functions:\n\n<pre>function ip_in_subnet_ipv4_or_ipv6($ip, $subnet) {\n   return ip_compare($ip, 'in', $subnet);\n}\n\nfunction ip_in_subnet_ipv4_only($ip, $subnet_ip, $subnet_bits) {\n   return ip_compare($ip, 'in', array('subnet', $subnet_ip, $subnet_bits), 4);\n}\n\nfunction ip1_less_than_ip2($ip1, $ip2) {\n   return ip_compare($ip1, '<', $ip2);\n}\n\nfunction ip1_less_than_ip2_ipv4_only($ip1, $ip2) {\n   return ip_compare($ip1, '<', $ip2, 4);\n}\n\nfunction subnets_overlap($sn1, $sn2) {\n   return ip_compare($sn1, 'overlaps', $sn2);\n}\n\nfunction range_disjoint_from_subnet($range_start, $range_end, $subnet_ip, $subnet_bits) {\n   return ip_compare(array('range', $range_start, $range_end), '!overlaps', array('subnet', $subnet_ip, $subnet_bits));\n}\n\nfunction subnet_in_subnet_ipv6_only($subnet1, $subnet2) {\n   return ip_compare($subnet1, 'included-in', $subnet2, 6);\n}\n\nfunction subnet_overlaps_range($subnet, $range) {\n   return ip_compare($subnet, 'overlaps', $range);\n}\n</pre>\n\n\nAnd some examples of actual code, taken from services_dhcp.php:\n\n<pre>\n(1)\n\nif (!ip_in_subnet($_POST['gateway'], gen_subnet($parent_ip, $parent_sn) . \"/\" . $parent_sn) ...\n\nEQUIVALENT:\n\nif (!ip_compare($_POST['gateway'], 'in', array('subnet', $parent_ip, $parent_sn), 4) ...\n</pre>\n\n\n<pre>\n(2)\n\n$subnet_start = ip2ulong(long2ip32(ip2long($ifcfgip) & gen_subnet_mask_long($ifcfgsn)));\n$subnet_end = ip2ulong(long2ip32(ip2long($ifcfgip) | (~gen_subnet_mask_long($ifcfgsn))));\nif (ip2ulong($_POST['range_from']) > ip2ulong($_POST['range_to'])) {\n    $input_errors[] = gettext(\"The range is invalid (first element higher than second element).\");\n}\nif (ip2ulong($_POST['range_from']) < $subnet_start || ip2ulong($_POST['range_to']) > $subnet_end) {\n    $input_errors[] = gettext(\"The specified range lies outside of the current subnet.\");\n}\n\nEQUIVALENT:\n\nif (!ip_compare(array('range', $_POST['range_from'], $_POST['range_to']), 'included-in', array('subnet', $ifcfgip, $ifcfgsn), 4)) {\n    $input_errors[] = gettext(\"The specified range is mis-ordered or not within the current subnet.\");\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n<pre>\n(3)\n\n$dynsubnet_start = ip2ulong($_POST['range_from']);\n$dynsubnet_end = ip2ulong($_POST['range_to']);\nif (is_array($a_maps)) {\n    foreach ($a_maps as $map) {\n        if (empty($map['ipaddr'])) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        if ((ip2ulong($map['ipaddr']) >= $dynsubnet_start) &&\n            (ip2ulong($map['ipaddr']) <= $dynsubnet_end)) {\n            $input_errors[] = sprintf(gettext(\"The DHCP range cannot overlap any static DHCP mappings.\"));\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n            \nEQUIVALENT:\n\nif (is_array($a_maps)) {\n    foreach ($a_maps as $map) {\n        if (!empty($map['ipaddr']) && ip_compare($map['ipaddr'], 'in', array('range', $_POST['range_from'], $_POST['range_to']), 4) {\n            $input_errors[] = gettext(\"The DHCP range cannot overlap any static DHCP mappings.\");\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</pre>\n", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/comments/2809351", "body": "I've added some info to the original thread on the \"to !/\" artifact bug which may be useful.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/comments/2809351/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "review_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/pulls/comments/9921733", "body": "Can you say a bit more, Im not sure I know which you are referring to.\n\nAnticipating what you might mean: - inet_ntop() returned FALSE if the IP isn't valid, which meant it rolled validation and conversion into one function, which was efficient.

It's mostly for comment at this point. \r\n\r\nThis is a very minimal effort to allow creation of dhcpd static host configurations on ipalias subnets. It is enabled by checking the \"Virtual IPs\" checkbox on the DHCPD service configuration view. Once enabled, the user will be able to create static mappings with addresses that match any subnet bound to the interface, including ipalias address subnets.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate this change, once enabled, the dhcpd.conf is modified to include all subnets of a given interface within a \"shared-network\" block named for the interface the subnets live on.

The OpenVPN client does a DNS lookup via /etc/hosts because of the /etc/nsswitch.conf config and tries to connect to the internal IP I configured in unbound for the LAN hosts, rather than public IP returned by the configured resolvers.

As it happens with the hard timeout setting, the client will still be able to reconnect immediately.\r\n\r\nPatch 3 (\"add option to retrieve the traffic quota value from RADIUS\") allows to get the value of the traffic quota from a RADIUS server. The value obtained is recorded in a new column in the active sessions' database, requiring some minor changes to use the right index to retrieve the radius context in other parts of the code. Since the feature uses a new vendor-specific attribute and I couldn't find a pfSense dictionary, I created a new one (see also the next patch), using Netgate's SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Code as per RFC. I defined 5 attributes, respectively to set upload quota, download quota, total quota, max upload bandwidth and max download bandwidth, even though only the total quota one is used in this patch series (I think the existing code should do the right thing for the bandwidth limits but I didn't test it). I hope this is OK.\r\n\r\nPatch 4 (\"Add RADIUS dictionary with definitions of the new pfSense vendor-specific attributes\") is the new FreeRADIUS compatible dictionary file for pfsense I was talking about earlier. The directory in which I placed it likely isn't the right place, in theory the dictionary, once approved, should be submitted to FreeRADIUS for inclusion and in the meantime added to the FreeRADIUS pkg available in pfSense.

I reviewed all the approx 1000 lines of this stuff looking for other similar cut-paste-change errors and these are all I could spot.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/pulls/comments/9852620/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/pulls/comments/9852642", "body": "Same as for line 400 - I guess the error propagated to the IPv6 case when the code was cut-paste-changed.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/pulls/comments/9852642/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/pulls/comments/9898486", "body": "You do not even need the \"? true : false\" stuff - you should be able to directly return the result of the expression: \nreturn ((is_int($arg) && $arg >= 0) || (is_string($arg) && strlen($arg) > 0 && ctype_digit($arg)));\nMight save another 10 CPUs cycles somewhere :)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/pulls/comments/9898486/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/pulls/comments/10164015", "body": "The tricky part is that, at the moment, when you are adding a new rule, $pconfig['ipprotocol'] is actually blank.

Doing that causes just the IPv4 gateways and GWGs to be listed.\nBut then when the user changes the IP version selection to IPv6, there is no code that triggers to rebuild the gateways dropdown list. So the user would have to save the rule with version IPv6 and \"default\" gateway, then edit it again (causing the gateways dropdown list to be correctly built for IPv6) and select the gateway they want.\nBecause of those side-effects, I abandoned compressing these tests like you suggest. To avoid the side-effects it needs some Java-Ajax fancy stuff to trigger the dropdown list being rebuilt when the user changes the IP version selection.\nI do have a nicely compressed version of these lines, but it has the (little?) side-effect I described.

One  \ncould use the \"Routing\" pages to manually add the required routes each  \ntime the tunnel is brought up. But this is a frankly a pain and an  \nunnecessary administration burden. All this together, means that  \nconnection attempts to anything but an unencrypted PPTP server generally  \nfail and even if it does connect successfully, traffic often doesn't get  \nproperly routed to the remote network.\n\nI believe that the original implementation of the PPTP client was only  \nintended for use with ISP that require this protocol for authentication  \nover A/DSL connections. In Australia, no ISP uses this technique, but many  \npeople here run their own private PPTP servers (usually on Windows) and  \nrequire configuration, specifically of the MPPE/MPPC options. I certainly  \nhave a use for this in my job as Systems Engineer for a home automation  \ncompany in Melbourne Australia, where we will make judicious use of  \npersistent tunnels between pfSense boxes all over the world. We are  \nintending to use this for several of our clients who require multiple  \nclient connections from their homes to their workplaces. As pfSense  \ndoesn't currently support mutli-passthrough of PPTP client connections, we  \nfelt that a persistent tunnel (or several) from the pfSesne FW itself  \nwould be an option as the tunnel/s could then be managed with firewall  \nrules, VLANS and possibly captive portals, to control local access to the  \nremote network.\n\nI'll update it to work with recent sources and re-submit the pull request.  \nThanks for your input.\n\nRegards,\n\nBen.\n\nOn Thu, 29 Mar 2012 19:05:08 +1100, Ermal Lu\u00e7i  \nreply@reply.github.com  \nwrote:\n\n> First use recent sources to do the pull request.\n> 2nd i though this already exists in pfSense?\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/bsdperimeter/pfsense/pull/68#issuecomment-4798634\n\n## \n\nUsing Opera's revolutionary email client: http://www.opera.com/mail/\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/issues/comments/4832715/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/issues/comments/4938639", "body": "Sorry Ermal but I applied this against the code pull from the GIT repo.  \nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nOn Wed, 04 Apr 2012 06:17:59 +1000, Ermal Lu\u00e7i  \nreply@reply.github.com  \nwrote:\n\n> Its still not against correct code!\n> Are you doing the patch against 2.0.x?\n> Then you should proper pull or correct the code to which you apply the  \n> patch.\n> \n> 1- Do not lose gettext()\n> 2- Do not remove code that is supposed to be there fro IPv6(Maybe pull  \n> against master while it should be against RELENG_2_0?)\n> ....\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/bsdperimeter/pfsense/pull/72#issuecomment-4926252\n\n## \n\nUsing Opera's revolutionary email client: http://www.opera.com/mail/\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/issues/comments/4938639/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/issues/comments/4941231", "body": "OK I think I know what I'm doing wrong.

Another reason is that this way is far easier to see the status. I bet most normal (ie non colorblind) people pay more attention to the color of the icon rather than the shape, and that's for a good reason. The reject icon is so light that the shape is very hard to see (at least to me), and they're all so small. As for the clutter, even with icon+text status it should allow descriptions of up to about 30 chars without problems when using the default theme, but if you still think it's better to put the text on a title popup then'll do it, no problem.

Realizing that only the detection in pf is broken, fixing that would have been an option as well.\n\n[1] http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/stable/8/contrib/pf/pfctl/pfctl.c?view=markup (line 1551)\n[2] http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/stable/8/sys/sys/sysctl.h?view=markup (~line 516)\n\nEdit: Just realized that the sysctl information is conflicting. In [2] both physmem and realmem are stated to be of type int but they are actually defined as unsigned long. Thus changing the type of mem in pfctl.c (line 1518) from int to unsigned long would probably fix the bug.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/comments/2445945/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pfsense/pfsense/comments/2446498", "body": "No it's only the default value that is used when the pfSense script does not overwrite it.
