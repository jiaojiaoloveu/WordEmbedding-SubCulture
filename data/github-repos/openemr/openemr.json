Currently, the logic is mostly coupled with the view (e.g.: direct database calls from the view, sometimes even copy/pasted several times).\r\n\r\nAs with all of the work in the backend modernization project, the view and the business logic/database logic should be separated so that (if we wanted to) we could make an OpenEMR REST API. Where possible, Doctrine should be used to provide a more modern object oriented approach, however, we know that `patient_data` and similar dynamic tables are a non-starter with Doctrine.\r\n\r\n## TASKS\r\n\r\n- [x] @MatthewVita, @kofiav, @juggernautsei: Find out all of the tables that deal with drugs, prescriptions, sales, inventory, pharmacies.\r\n- [ ] @MatthewVita, @kofiav: Study how the code works currently with reference to the following tables:\r\n  - `drugs`\r\n  - `drug_inventory`\r\n  - `drug_sales`\r\n  - `drug_templates`\r\n  - `product_warehouse`\r\n  - `prices`\r\n  - `prescriptions`\r\n  - `pharmacies`\r\n  - `phone_numbers`\r\n  - `addresses`\r\n  - `erx_drug_paid`\r\n  - `erx_narcotics`\r\n  - `erx_rx_log`\r\n  - `patient_data`\r\n- [ ] @juggernautsei: Think about how these should be split up into here: https://github.com/openemr/openemr/tree/master/services (remember that very specific services are fine too. For example, we already have a `PatientService` (recently created and doesn't do too much, however). It would be totally fine to create a `PatientPrescriptionService` that is called into from something like `patientServiceInstance->getAllPrescriptionsForPatient(pid)`). In other words, the `PatientService` could be a _facade_ to all of these other services.\r\n- [ ] @MatthewVita: Start to think about how we can separate up the work in terms of making individual tickets (obviously this current ticket doesn't encapulate everything)\r\n\r\n## HANGOUTS\r\n\r\nOnce Sherwin makes some progress with the \"Think about how these should be split up\" task, I believe it is a great idea to have a Google Hangout so he can explain his findings.

I think it needs to be switched from providerID to ref_providerID:\n\n```\n$query = \"SELECT f.id, f.date, f.pid, f.encounter, f.last_level_billed, \" .\n  \"f.last_level_closed, f.last_stmt_date, f.stmt_count, f.invoice_refno, \" .\n  \"p.fname, p.mname, p.lname, p.street, p.city, p.state, \" .\n  \"p.postal_code, p.phone_home, p.ss, p.genericname2, p.genericval2, \" .\n  \"p.pubpid, p.DOB, CONCAT(u.lname, ', ', u.fname) AS referrer, \" .\n  \"( SELECT SUM(b.fee) FROM billing AS b WHERE \" .\n  \"b.pid = f.pid AND b.encounter = f.encounter AND \" .\n  \"b.activity = 1 AND b.code_type != 'COPAY' ) AS charges, \" .\n  \"( SELECT SUM(b.fee) FROM billing AS b WHERE \" .\n  \"b.pid = f.pid AND b.encounter = f.encounter AND \" .\n  \"b.activity = 1 AND b.code_type = 'COPAY' ) AS copays, \" .\n  \"( SELECT SUM(s.fee) FROM drug_sales AS s WHERE \" .\n  \"s.pid = f.pid AND s.encounter = f.encounter ) AS sales, \" .\n  \"( SELECT SUM(a.pay_amount) FROM ar_activity AS a WHERE \" .\n  \"a.pid = f.pid AND a.encounter = f.encounter ) AS payments, \" .\n  \"( SELECT SUM(a.adj_amount) FROM ar_activity AS a WHERE \" .\n  \"a.pid = f.pid AND a.encounter = f.encounter ) AS adjustments \" .\n  \"FROM form_encounter AS f \" .\n  \"JOIN patient_data AS p ON p.pid = f.pid \" .\n  \"LEFT OUTER JOIN users AS u ON u.id = p.providerID \" .\n  \"WHERE $where \" .\n  \"ORDER BY f.pid, f.encounter\";\n$eres = sqlStatement($query);\n```\n\nOtherwise, both referrer and referrerID were not actually used or collected in OpenEMR, so I could not assume what they were (ie. is the id and id from the user table or some other id). Because of this discrepancy and the fact they are not used in the codebase, I created a new entry ref_providerID, which stores the id from the user table. I must say this was one of the oddest bugs, a database field was storing both the primary physician and referring physician id (so, you could either bill correctly or calculate AMC per physician correctly, but could not do both...). And the solution I came up with was all I could think of to squash the bug and work seamlessly for upgraders.\n\nlooks like this entry may need to be added to the  custom/import_xml.php and custom/export_xml.php scripts. Added these things that need to be done here:\nhttp://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Active_Projects#Assigned_Provider_ID_and_Referring_Provider_ID_conflict_bug_fix_update\n\n-brady\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/1503717/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/1524053", "body": "fixed this and committed to sourceforge\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/1524053/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2314286", "body": "I think I need to bring $sanitize_all_escapes in as a global here... oops.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2314286/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2314290", "body": "Will add something like this:\n[code]\n  // Bring in $sanitize_all_escapes variable, which will decide\n  //  the variable escaping method.\n  global $sanitize_all_escapes;\n[/code]\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2314290/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2406076", "body": "oops, I should not of let these formData calls in.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2406076/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2406080", "body": "oops, I should not of let these formData calls in.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2406080/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2406084", "body": "oops, I should not of let these formData calls in.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2406084/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2610218", "body": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/482202/is-there-a-performance-benefit-single-quote-vs-double-quote-in-php\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2610218/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2611158", "body": "Hi,\nI'd bring this up in the forums since it's Julia Longtin's contribution, whom doesn't use github, at the following forum thread:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/openemr/forums/forum/202506/topic/6700777\n-brady\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2611158/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2664292", "body": "Thanks for reporting this bug.\nRod committed a fix for this here (note it is based on the current development version):\nhttp://github.com/openemr/openemr/commit/889601cdb8671f0de591956cf86b249bcd394728\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/2664292/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/comments/3043387", "body": "Agreed.

Sepsis kills over 40,000 people in the UK every year.\r\n\r\nMy aim is to build a similar tool for OpenEMR which takes into account ICD9 and 10 codes, keywords and vital measurements e.g. temperature to assess a patient for Sepsis and if necessary flag a warning up to the doctor.\r\n\r\nImage: An example of the popup we get in SystmOne. In this case I typed in the history that the patient had a fever and increased heart rate and this popup was triggered.\r\n![screenshot 2017-08-20 21 50 38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4623934/29591051-b9592df6-8794-11e7-91f6-7d58059e5631.png)\r\n\r\nPDF File: An example of the protocol which would be followed for diagnosis\r\nhttps://www.nuh.nhs.uk/media/1725749/newsstforobs_chart.pdf\r\n\r\n**Questions**\r\n\r\nDevelopers - how would you best integrate this feature into OpenEMR? I am aware that there are clinical reminders in each patient - but this is more for routine items and only loads when the record is refreshed. \r\n\r\nI have had a quick play with some code and have some code sitting in the `save.php`code which saves the encounter. If the word 'fever' is seen in the consultation notes, it presents a javascript alert. Obviously in the production version it would be a bit more complex - we would look at ICD9/10 codes and vitals measurements as well (and even the age of the patient is a factor) to get a better picture. \r\nI would probably put the main bulk of the code in /library and then php require it in to `save.php` so it acts as a middleware of sorts. \r\n\r\nThis brings me neatly on to my second question... in my brief example I have entered data only into the main brief description field.\r\n\r\n![screenshot 2017-08-22 23 57 53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4623934/29591332-fd097ce4-8795-11e7-9e7f-1c7e7e1e726d.png)\r\n \r\nAs we all know, OpenEMR has so many various forms (SOAP, Treatment Plan etc) where this info could be written that my mind is spinning working just how to handle all these different sources! Advice appreciated. Maybe we need to poll some of the users of OpenEMR where they enter the most of their information. Do they code everything such as 'fever', and enter temperature into the right form, or are they lazy and just free-text it all into one box? \r\n\r\nIf this is the case, I also have some code in the works which would take the phrase...\r\n\"patient has a temperature of 39\" and extract the 39 so we can perform operations on it. Obviously this wouldn't be perfect and I haven't worked out how to handle people using fahrenheit or celsius. I don't want so many false positives that users start ignoring the alerts.\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer**\r\n\r\nObviously this goes without saying but this would be a tool to aid, not replace clinical judgement. In an ideal scenario a popup will be generated explaining WHY the system thinks the patient is a sespsis risk along with a pathway for the doctor to follow to further screen patient. \r\n\r\nI would LIKE the feature to be on by default, with the option of turning it off... purely because of the amount of lives claimed by Sepsis. However, if we need to turn it off by default I will oblige!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/1035/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/pulls/1030", "title": "Self checkin feature", "body": "# Patient Self Checkin Feature\r\n\r\nThis feature allows patients to check themselves in for their appointment using a touch screen kiosk, for example this - (http://www.jayex.com/images/slideshows/patient-check-in//17in-kiosks.jpg) \r\nHowever, OpenEMR is web based - all you need is a web browser, so a spare iPad/tablet could be wall mounted and used for the checking in of patients.\r\n\r\nThe feature is found at http(s)://YourServerHere/portal/patient_self_checkin/\r\n\r\n**Why is it useful?**\r\n\r\nIt frees up reception staff to answer the phone, deal with prescription queries etc. When the patient checks themself in, the same features are performed as when the reception checks them in.

Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/632/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "AppChecker": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/619", "title": "Possible bugs in source code (CWE-480)", "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nWe've checked your code with [AppChecker static analyzer](https://cnpo.ru/en/solutions/appchecker.php) and found possible bugs:\r\n\r\n1)\r\nhttps://github.com/openemr/openemr/blob/ee0945a30dbb17ceee82b9b553d7dcb177710ca8/interface/orders/orders_results.php#L613\r\n\r\n```\r\n    echo \"  <td>\" .\r\n      \"<input type='text' size='16' name='form_result_text[$lino]'\" .\r\n      \" class='celltext' value='\" . attr($result_text) . \"' />\";\r\n      \"</td>\\n\";\r\n```\r\n`</td>\\n` doesn't refer to echo\r\n\r\n2)\r\nhttps://github.com/openemr/openemr/blob/ee0945a30dbb17ceee82b9b553d7dcb177710ca8/interface/batchcom/settingsnotification.php#L89\r\n\r\n```\r\n<INPUT TYPE=\"password\" NAME=\"SMS_gateway_username\" size=\"40\" value=\"<?php $SMS_gateway_username?>\">\r\n...\r\n<INPUT TYPE=\"password\" NAME=\"SMS_gateway_password\" size=\"40\" value=\"<?php $SMS_gateway_password?>\">\r\n...\r\n<INPUT TYPE=\"text\" NAME=\"SMS_gateway_apikey\" size=\"40\" value=\"<?php $SMS_gateway_apikey?>\">\r\n```\r\n$SMS_gateway_username, $SMS_gateway_password and $SMS_gateway_apikey are not displayed\r\n\r\n3)\r\nhttps://github.com/openemr/openemr/blob/ee0945a30dbb17ceee82b9b553d7dcb177710ca8/interface/main/calendar/find_patient.php#L205\r\n\r\n```\r\n<body class=\"body_bottom\" <?php $body_code;?>>\r\n```\r\n$body_code  is not displayed\r\n\r\nPossible defects were found by Echelon Team with [AppChecker static analyzer](https://cnpo.ru/en/solutions/appchecker.php)\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/619/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/comments/212771700", "body": "@bradymiller Yes, we're developers of one php source code static analyzer called AppChecker and\nwe've just checked this project.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/comments/212771700/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "georgetye": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/586", "title": "Hover to show dropdown menus", "body": "See this picture:\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/oUA5fI3.png\r\n\r\nWhile the items on the top menu bar (\"Calendar\", \"Flow Board\", \"Messages\") all display their dropdown options after hovering, the items on the encounter page (\"Administrative\" and \"Clinical\") only display their dropdown options after clicking.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't mind trying to figure out how to do this (doesn't seem like it would be hard), but I might not be the fastest at it.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/586/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "mrpenelope": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/568", "title": "Patient Photograph on Calendar", "body": "The patient photograph that pre-exists in the patient Documents be able to be viewed (with an option) on the Calendar tooltip when you hover over a patients name.

Very frustrating.  \n\nThere is a lot of code there - would be nice to have access to programmers. What I hacked up in 4 months they'd have done in a few weeks!  \n\nThough there are a lot of changes the form is functioning well enough I think for testing by a wide audience. \n\nI am nearly done removing the extract $_REQUEST AND $_SESSION.  \n\nI did not address the table changes for past ocular hx etc yet.\n\nThere is no delete eye_mag and revert back to original unscathed yet. \n\n I haven't started the higher order logic for customizing the form on a user basis over time - this will be interesting but I do not think it is needed to get a functioning form out the door.  \n\nI am learning how to integrate a form into openemr and use the pre existing code.  \n\nThe ROS needs to be done.  I will revise the preexisting form and link to it using the menu system you built in the framed version.  In the full screen view, there is a new menu which I am getting ready to tackle. I will need to see how the framed menu is built to learn how items are chosen for display to do it correctly.  \n\nThe imp plan needs to be built. It is just two pitiful fields today. With user actions, we should be able to prepopulate the icd9/10 codes. Also it should have a way of displaying past codes... It needs to have separate sections for each issue, so it may need a new table.  \n\nAlthough you can have more than one Chief complaint, I limited the form to three.  If someone needs more, then it will require a new table too. The new table will allow a one-to-many relationship. One encounter, many options. I see this as possible with not only the chief complaint and the imp plan area but also refractions and glasses.  Some people show up with 5 pairs of glasses and the eye doc has to figure out what's up! \n\nWell with that the form should be something an eyedoc would actually enjoy using. Key is to wrap it up in such a way that it speeds up the encounter.  That is my real goal. \n\nRay\n\n> On Mar 30, 2015, at 4:35 AM, Brady Miller notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Hi,\n> \n> Sorry didn't get to it this weekend.

The previous attempt used two loops and two\nimplodes to generate that portion of the query, which adds a few\nunnecessary opp codes with no added benefits; additionally an implode is\nmuch more efficient than a loop by far. This code is already used in loops,\nmaking it more complex than needed increases its CRAP score needlessly. If\nI'd seen any merit in using multiple placeholders I would have fixed the\nloop instead of removing it.\n\nThanks,\n\nSam Likins\n\nWSI-Services\nOwner / Creative Developer\nMaking Things Work\n_727.490.WSIS (9747)_\n\nOn Sat, Dec 26, 2015 at 6:56 AM, Brady Miller notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Hi Sam,\n> \n> What are your thoughts on using this fix instead(using a placemaker for\n> each variable rather than one for the entire array; also stays away from\n> the implode stuff and just manages it using arrays):\n> bradymiller@0718ff5\n> https://github.com/bradymiller/openemr/commit/0718ff564d34da3cc2ed23b73c26f152c996a86a\n> \n> -brady\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/openemr/openemr/pull/88#issuecomment-167318759.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/comments/167346874/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "kchapple": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/comments/103127359", "body": "While I agree with the importance of autoloading, I'm not sure about checking in a hard-coded configuration to the project.

The simple-refset file is/will be empty since this last release. The simple refsets that were there have been moved to extensions, because they really are an extension mechanism. The division between core content (concepts, descriptions and relations between them) and extensions (subsets, mappings to other code systems, etc) has become more distinct with the latest release.\n\nWhen you import an extension, you should retain the same tables but with extra content - and the difference will be most noticeable in the simple-refset table.\n\n\u00a0\nThe presentation you found gives a nice overview of the RF2 structure. If you are interested in learning more about SNOMED, I would recommend that you read (parts of) the IHTSDO Starter Guide. It contains an extensive introduction to the purpose and underlying principles of SNOMED, which explains why the system is so complicated and how it should be used.\n\n\u00a0\nThe full specification of the RF2 tables is available in section 5 of the Technical Guide. That Guide is succinct and probably mystifying if it's your first exposure to SNOMED, but it does contain all relevant details. Both documents are available here: http://snomed.org/fileadmin/user_upload/doc/directory.html\n\n\u00a0\nOf course I'm also happy to answer any questions you have about SNOMED - in fact, it is my job to answer such questions ;-)\n\n\u00a0\nCheers,\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeikje\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nVan: Brady Miller [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nVerzonden: zaterdag 10 oktober 2015 12:53\nAan: openemr/openemr\nCC: Feikje Hielkema\nOnderwerp: Re: [openemr] Import snomed rf2 (#68)\n\n\u00a0\nWas just able to import the international rf2 set with this code.
