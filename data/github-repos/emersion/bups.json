As a workaround one can of course add `~/.dbus` on the exclude list.\r\n```\r\nread Linux attr: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/username/.dbus/' \r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/bup/cmd/bup-index\", line 269, in <module>\r\n    update_index(rp, excluded_paths, exclude_rxs, xdev_exceptions=xexcept)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/bup/cmd/bup-index\", line 164, in update_index\r\n    wi.add(path, pst, meta_ofs, hashgen=fake_hash)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/bup/bup/index.py\", line 565, in add\r\n    self._add(ename, e)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/bup/bup/index.py\", line 533, in _add\r\n    % (''.join(ename), ''.join(self.lastfile)))\r\n```\r\n- When the home directory is encrypted with ecryptfs, the encrypted files are stored in `.Private`. I don't know what that error means, but since bup takes up the unencrypted files anyways, I put it on my exclude list.\r\n```\r\nbup.index.Error: '/home/username/.Private' must come before '/home/username/.Private'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are issues that many users will encounter and that are not bup/bups' fault. There may even be other system software that creates root-owned files in home (as pulseaudio did). Since these errors are caused by individual files, I wonder whether it makes sense to abort backing up all other files, or whether these errors should be handled somehow?\r\n\r\n- Show a prompt about the error and ask the user whether to continue:\r\n  [Abort] [Continue] [Continue and add files \u2026 on exclude list]\r\n\r\n- Or just continue backing up other files first and show a summary of not backuped files.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/emersion/bups/issues/30/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/emersion/bups/issues/comments/320439697", "body": "I worked around this (on Ubuntu Gnome) by symlinking \r\n`sudo mkdir /usr/lib/ssh/; sudo ln -s /usr/lib/openssh/gnome-ssh-askpass /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-askpass`\r\nThere exists also `/etc/alternatives/ssh-askpass` which is probably the safer path to use?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/emersion/bups/issues/comments/320439697/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "fandjelo": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/emersion/bups/issues/28", "title": "Another schedulers can't be selected if anacron is available on the system", "body": "In gtk.py:497 the call to get_job() for anacron returns some good value, so another schedulers, like systemctl are not checked anymore.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/emersion/bups/issues/28/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commits": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/emersion/bups/commits/a9087088ea1b161c6f8576cb7044f87f8bb436c4", "message": "Now trying to derive the config folder from XDG env, improved systemctl availibility detection"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/emersion/bups/commits/5c409761c4bca45e319a721f61e237973a3f3942", "message": "Added better detection of systemctl availibility"}], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/emersion/bups/issues/comments/318488168", "body": "Yes, I am.
