All packages that are neither in Ring0 nor Ring1, nor have baselibs.conf, nor are required by any of the former are build disabled.\r\n\r\nNow this causes two issues in staging:\r\n1. repochecker gets confused if a staging project contains a delete request for package A and an update for package B when only the old package B required A. If B is build for i586 in the main project but not in staging, repochecker would still think B depends on A as it sees the old binaries in the target.\r\n2. ADI stagings are grouped. If one of the packages in the group contains baselibs.conf, all packages are built for i586. That will fail for most of them of course.\r\n\r\nSo in order to fix both issues I wonder whether the staging tools should mirror the build flags of the main project always? Ie we could enable i586 in staging and when whenever a package get selected into a staging project, the build disable setting from the main project would have to be copied.\r\nSecondly, on accept the command could apply the build flags in the target too. That way stagings could change the build flags.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/issues/1357/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/issues/1324", "title": "TODO list for staging accept", "body": "sometimes it's important to remember something for staging accept, e.g changing the rebuild mode, modifying the prjconf etc. Would be nice to have some way to store some free form text that is shown on accept.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/issues/1324/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/issues/1310", "title": "bs_mirrorfull: add timeout parameter", "body": "https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1290 indicated that bs_mirrorfull needs to use the timeout parameter of BSRPC::rpc to avoid hanging forever.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/issues/1310/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/issues/1282", "title": "manager42: check pending requests", "body": "before marking a packages coming from e.g. Factory as FORK, check pending requests to the origin project.

The repo_checker has no way to know that it should ignore the binaries from all the previous state of spec files in target project and instead looks for the renamed package in the target project which does not exist so only binaries from the non-renamed packages are ignored.\r\n\r\nShort of always making API calls for all updated packges this seems a bit cumbersome to deal with. Interestingly the new `_multibuild` style packages work just fine with this setup since all the binaries produced are associated with a single OBS package container. It almost begs if there are any technical reasons remaining to prevent all such packages from being ported to `_multibuild` as logically it simplifies a number areas the staging tools currently have to deal with or lack.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one approach would be to look for all packages in target project that are links to other packages in target project and keep a lookup map. Anytime a request for a package (root package) exists then automatically ignore all binaries from subpackages. Even if the subpackages are detected and ignored a second time the net ignore `set()` would be correct in both the rename and non-rename case without having to explicitly detect it.\r\n\r\nThe possible edge-case is for packages that do not have all their subpackages duplicated in the rings. Ignoring the ones not built in rings may cause unresolveable install-time dependencies. Obviously this would be another case for enforcing install-time deps to be resolved within rings.\r\n\r\nOverall, short of the install-time deps rule being enforced for rings solving this with code may simple trade one problem for another. From what I can see prioritizing `_multibuild` and install-time deps resolved within rings solves both of these problems without requiring a tooling change.

It only checks if the new request ID is larger than the one already staged. In general this distinction seems arbitrary and for Leap likely makes even less sense. With the exposing of the other `supersede` functionality via its own command that would seem preferred over some sort of logic in `select`.\r\n\r\nFrom reading the code, it would seem it allows for one to do an implicit move from one staging to another as long as there is an open request that is considered superseding (greater ID and same target package). The code shares the path of move which is intriguing.\r\n\r\nUnless I am mistake the logic seems a bit off (and the message backwards). The final call:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nself.api.move_between_project(fprj, request, self.target_project)\r\n```\r\nfor a `--move` makes sense, but supersede:\r\n\r\n- `fprj` will be the project containing an older request for same package\r\n- `request` (should be `request_id`) ID of newer request\r\n- `target_project` the argument from command line\r\n\r\nThe message seems backwards:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint('\"{} ({}) is superseded by {}'.format(request, supersede[1], supersede[0]))\r\n# new_request_id (package) is superseded by old_request_id\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe move code, unless I am mistaken, tries to remove the new request ID from the specified project. This should fail since it is not staged there and so it ends up doing nothing, but prints seemingly misleading message about `superseded` and `moving`.\r\n\r\nAssuming no one is running into this since I believe one would have to issue a rather unusual command in order to do so. I simply decided to review while I was tweaking the supersede logic for #842. The original commits reference a \"corner case\" and the code was changed several times.\r\n\r\nForcing `_supersede()` to always `return None` does not cause any test failures that might help illuminate the reasoning.
