After contacting the support and a few tests I think I have found the cause for this. Regarding the instructions you should set your service url like \"http://localhost:3000\", but you need to enter a slash at the end like \"http://localhost:3000/\". The Library connects to \"http://localhost:3000merchant/...\" instead of \"http://localhost:3000/merchant/...\". This is a silly solution so I changed the setServiceUrl function to add a slash if missing. I also added a pull request for this.
