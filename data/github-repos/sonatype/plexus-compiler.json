I tried just removing that check. But that created other issues because the code assumes that for any other identifier, it is a package as long as there doesn't exist a `some/package/name.java` or `some/package/name.class` file corresponding to the identifier. So the `WrongClassname` test fails because it thinks `org.codehaus.foo.RightClassname` is a package name (the only thing keeping it from being recognized as a package in the past was the fact that it started with an upper case letter).\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sonatype/plexus-compiler/issues/comments/213470405/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sonatype/plexus-compiler/issues/comments/213556366", "body": "I'll re-open on codehaus-plexus.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sonatype/plexus-compiler/issues/comments/213556366/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "kellyrob99": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sonatype/plexus-compiler/issues/comments/239030672", "body": "@md-5 No, the ownership of this plugin has moved to https://github.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-compiler\nWe haven't supported this plugin directly for quite some time.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sonatype/plexus-compiler/issues/comments/239030672/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "Stephan202": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sonatype/plexus-compiler/comments/9533635", "body": "s/cannonical/canonical/\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sonatype/plexus-compiler/comments/9533635/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "review_comments": []}}}}
