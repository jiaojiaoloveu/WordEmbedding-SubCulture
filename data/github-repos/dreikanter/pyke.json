And thanks for the note regarding encoding definition.\n\nPyke is an answer for my own question: \"What is the most simple and straightforward way to add a command line interface to Python script?\" The goal of this project is to provide most simple, laconic, and usable way to implement CLI.\n\nPyke translates function definitions from a Python script directly to `argparse` parser configuration, and there are no other mandatory requirements or syntax constructions (like decorators or specific docstrings) over standard Python code to get an up-and-running CLI parser. The whole thing was inspired by function annotations introduced in Python 3.3. This feature is used for additional capabilities like command line help and type validation.\n\nSo this is a short story behind Pyke )\n\nRegarding Python 2 support and decorators. I believe it's possible to support Python 2 (2.7 at least). But type definitions and usage help won't work. And it is also possible to use decorators in Python 2 to fix this problem. At the moment I don't have any plans to support Python 2. I'm using Python 3 myself, and there are a lot of existing decorator-based command line libraries. Baker and argh are good examples. Both of them are not rake-like tools, but they make a pretty trivial task to implement one.\n\nResuming, I don't see a lot of sense to add decorators to Pyke because it throws away the original idea. But you can fork it freely anyway.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dreikanter/pyke/issues/comments/26139280/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "clbn": {"issues": [], "commits": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dreikanter/pyke/commits/5330de8f471c31b389fc48c681d8ae91c7e7e50b", "message": "Fix project link and a few typos in README.md"}], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}}}}
