However, the routine used to handle the saving\nof these custom taxonomy meta boxes was not customizable, but was instead\nbased simply on whether the taxonomy was hierarchicaly. See [13535].\n\nThe new `meta_box_sanitize_cb` argument defaults to the \"tag\" routine for\nnon-hierarchical taxonomies and the \"category\" routine for hierarchical ones,\nthereby maintaining the current default behavior.

I assume it is a global set somewhere? Do you handle `$hmac` not being defined? Is that what you are 'hardening' against?\n- Why are you hashing again when one of the inputs is a MD5 hash? At the very least, `$hash` is the result of `hash_hmac('md5', ...)` on the username and expiration, so it is unnecessary to hash it again unless your goal is to somehow 'harden' this test by applying a second level of hashing. It is unclear whether this accomplishes anything since you are doing the second layer for both values at the point of comparison (I can't imagine this does anything). Is the use of `hash_hmac` on both sides here an attempt to prevent side-channel timing attacks? If so, it is faulty, since you're still doing a string comparison on the end result. If you want to prevent side-channel timing attacks, use a constant-time string comparison, and don't use `hash_hmac` a second time. \n- Also, one could argue that comparing hashes of the values instead of comparing the values is introducing the possibility of a md5 collision attack here, but since `$hash` is already an md5 going in to the hash call, I'll assume `$hmac` is too so the risk is nil.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/WordPress/WordPress/comments/5949048/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "review_comments": []}, "kivikakk": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/WordPress/WordPress/comments/5949235", "body": "The property of a HMAC is that `HMAC(K, x) = HMAC(K, y)` if `x = y`.
