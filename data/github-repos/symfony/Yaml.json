If it could replace a lot of compilers in core.. perhaps worth it, but eventually each tag comes with it's own logic, including how to deal with tag attributes.\n\nHowever, writing the passes over and over again becomes tedious for the most basic usecase. So given the recent developments, this idea came to mind.\n\n```yml\nservices:\n    a:\n        class: stdClass\n        properties: { a: true }\n        tags: [foo]\n\n    b:\n        class: stdClass\n        properties: { b: true }\n        tags: [foo]\n\n    c:\n        class: stdClass\n        properties:\n            #stds: !tagged_services foo (see #22198)\n            stds: !tagged_services\n                foo\n```\n\n```\ndump(iterator_to_array($this->get('c')->stds));\n```\n\n```\narray:2 [\u25bc\n  0 => {#5052 \u25bc\n    +\"a\": true\n  }\n  1 => {#4667 \u25bc\n    +\"b\": true\n  }\n]\n```\n\nGiven the _basic_ example at https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/tags.html, this could replace that.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nCommits\n-------\n\n979e58f [DI]

I first wanted to set up a build step that would lint all YAML files found in that project to be able to report it inside the CI. While doing so I noticed that the lint command was ignoring all deprecations after all. I suggest that catch all deprecations triggered by the YAML components and turn them into reported errors here. If we think that this could be seen as misbehaviour as the Symfony YAML parser is still able to handle these files properly, we could think about adding an additional option to the command that would turn on the deprecation handling.\n\nCommits\n-------\n\n9b4206ff73 report deprecations when linting YAML files"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/yaml/commits/76ae7f27e17ab4e5e177d8f9aa6c116d56fe47df", "message": "minor #22067 [Yaml] ParseException: pcre.backtrack_limit reached (nicolas-grekas)\n\nThis PR was merged into the 3.3-dev branch.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n[Yaml] ParseException: pcre.backtrack_limit reached\n\n| Q             | A\n| ------------- | ---\n| Branch?       | master\n| Bug fix?      | no\n| New feature?  | no\n| BC breaks?    | no\n| Deprecations? | no\n| Tests pass?   | no\n| Fixed tickets | -\n| License       | MIT\n| Doc PR        | -\n\nwhile merging 3.2 into master, I noticed that `testCanParseVeryLongValue` is triggering this error on master, due to this regexp that we added for handling yaml tags.
