If the `install.rdf` file contains a valid XXE payload (like the billion laughs attack https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack), this can cause a DoS scenario (and possibly even code execution). \r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver/blob/139980fb59bb0e48e47a1bc515ee4fb6e6848780/lib/Firefox/FirefoxProfile.php#L209\r\n\r\n### Remediation\r\nPrior to loading any xml, disable entities ensuring that the above-mentioned attacks will no longer be possible.\r\n`libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);`\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n* Php-webdriver version: 1.5.0\r\n* PHP version: 7.2.0\r\n* Selenium server version: 3.8.1\r\n* Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n* Browser used + version: Firefox\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/issues/519/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "sapzape": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/issues/513", "title": "Take element screenshot not implemented in php-webdriver", "body": "As per spec: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#dfn-take-element-screenshot\r\nTake element screenshot is not implemented in php-webdriver.

The concepts are very similar to the Java, .NET, Python and Ruby bindings for WebDriver.\n\nLooking for documentation about Selenium WebDriver? See http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/ and https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki\n\nThe PHP client was rewritten from scratch. Using the old version? Check out Adam Goucher's fork of it at https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver\n```\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/issues/comments/24316350/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/pulls/comments/5776297", "body": "Awesome, thanks for the reference!\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/pulls/comments/5776297/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/pulls/comments/5777665", "body": "Any preference on `false` vs `FALSE`? \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/pulls/comments/5777665/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}]}, "DavertMik": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/issues/comments/23114434", "body": "Then I'm Interested in contributing. \nIf you create a stub for WebActions class I could add some basic actions (click, touch, etc).\n\nAlso I'm really exited of job you did.
