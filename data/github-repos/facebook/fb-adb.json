(If that assumption is wrong, the response leaks into stdin of the program being executed.)  For race-free behavior, we need to respond to the query either before sending any newline, or not at all.\n\n(You'll also note that `fputs(ESC\"[6n\", stdout)` is hard-coded, so it's the only escape sequence that we need to consider here.  Current behavior without this patch is to fail if we see anything that isn't an exact echo of the command we sent, so this patch just makes that check a bit more permissive.)\n\nIt turns out that we can avoid all of the races and most of the complexity by just ignoring the ESC\"[6n\" escape sequence if we happen to see it while we're entering a command into the prompt.  It's a hack, but given the inherently broken design of the *nix tty system (in-band signaling; ugh), I don't think we can do much better without making the code more complex and/or less reliable.\n\nFundamentally, it seems to be impossible for `chat_swallow_prompt` to exist with the semantics that we'd like; we can't swallow all of the escape sequences in a race-free way without transmitting something that can be echoed back.  To reflect this, it might also make sense to declare `chat_swallow_prompt` static and to add an extra flag to `chat_talk_at` that determines whether it tries to swallow the prompt.  (I considered including that in my patch, but I wasn't sure whether such a change would be welcome here.)  Nothing about this patch prevents that from being done after it's applied.\n\n## \n\n[1] Peeking at the input buffer is racy, and there's not really a good way to do it anyway because select/poll/etc work directly on filedescriptors, and we're using buffered stdio `FILE` streams, which provide no API for peeking at their input buffers at all.\n\n[2] We could maybe transmit some sentinel and then backspace it, but that's surprising behavior for a function called `chat_swallow_prompt`, and backspace escape sequences are their own separate nightmare.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/fb-adb/issues/comments/213921515/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/fb-adb/issues/comments/213921701", "body": "Also, I just signed the CLA.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/fb-adb/issues/comments/213921701/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/fb-adb/issues/comments/214038171", "body": "I've added another commit, which turns `chat_swallow_prompt` into a private implementation detail of `chat_talk_at`, which accepts a new `CHAT_SWALLOW_PROMPT` flag.
