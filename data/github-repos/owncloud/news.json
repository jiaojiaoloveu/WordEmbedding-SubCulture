I thought this was useful once, but we did not need it\n- Also implement a modified date for feeds and folders so you don't have to fetch everything all over again\n- Provide helper routes to make syncing a breeze. You normally have three usecases, those should be reflected by three routes\n  - Initial sync: Fetch feeds, folders, unread + starred items: **GET /api/2.0.0/sync**\n  - Sync local changes (no return appart from errors because the next GET request fetches all changed items anyways):  **POST /api/2.0.0/sync** \n  \n  ``` json\n  {\"items\": [{\"id\": 1, \"read\": true, \"fingerprint\": \"some_hash\"}]}\n  ```\n  \n    The fingerprint is a hash over the title, url, content and enclosures and if it is the same in the current database, only the status (read/starred) will be returned to the client.\n  - Checking for new contents without changes:: **GET /api/2.0.0/sync**  + http cache headers\n\nThe response will be the changes.\n\nFurthermore creating feeds/folders that already exist should respond with the existing object instead of just returning an error message. This makes it very easy to create folders: you just submit the contents and if you get a 409 you just use the returned contents.\n\nIdeas? Suggestions?\n\n@David-Development @phedlund @icewind1991 @jangernert @cosenal \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloudarchive/news/issues/862/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloudarchive/news/issues/202", "title": "Automatically load in news items", "body": "After using the app for a while i im a bit annoyed that the items arent loaded in automatically.

I started developing the news app because I knew that if i dont do it, it wont be to my likes. So if you want this feature implemented, please get your hands dirty and send me a pull request ;)\n\nTo minimize the maintenance I require working unittests for the PR\n\nI've already created the basic infrastructure to support multiple fetchers. You just need to create a class that implements https://github.com/owncloud/news/blob/master/utility/ifeedfetcher.php and plug it into the fetcher before https://github.com/owncloud/news/blob/master/dependencyinjection/dicontainer.php#L134\n\nThe best way to implement the canHandle method should be to test the url with a regex and return true if it finds it. Also think of users that leave out the http:// or www ;)\n\nIf you need help, just contact me on IRC or via Mail, Im glad to help\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloudarchive/news/issues/comments/15764884/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloudarchive/news/issues/comments/15771117", "body": "I've added a simple implementation that only transforms the url https://github.com/owncloud/news/blob/master/utility/twitterfetcher.php\n\nThis is not future proof though, im waiting for a correct twitter api implementation via PR.\n\nBTW: Google and Facebook use APIs which require a lot more work and I'll wait for a  PR for those too\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloudarchive/news/issues/comments/15771117/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloudarchive/news/issues/comments/15804670", "body": "hehe thanks for doing my work ;)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloudarchive/news/issues/comments/15804670/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloudarchive/news/issues/comments/15806034", "body": "Now who says i wont get pull requests ;D\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloudarchive/news/issues/comments/15806034/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloudarchive/news/issues/comments/15853619", "body": "This is a development version, we dont (not yet, doctrine will solve that i hope) have schema migrations so i cant handle this.

I now always return the unreadcount as 0 from a mark as read request. It can still happen that an update request finishes earlier and sets the unreadcount to some number, but it should be reset to 0 instantly after the mark read request finishes.\n\nThis is a downside for immediately showing the read feedback instead of waiting for the server response first to set it because it means that it can get out of sync cc @jancborchardt \n\nAnother possible scenario would be that the count database request counts while the read feed request sets the items as unread (although im not sure if i can fix that)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloudarchive/news/issues/comments/16494372/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloudarchive/news/issues/comments/16501062", "body": "The thing is that you cant do any CSRF checks when using subscriblets.
