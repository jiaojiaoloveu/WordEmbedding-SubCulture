Same with nightclub itineraries. A club that is open from 22:00 - 05:00 needs to be able to list their artists' playing times in sequential order. \n\nFor our custom built agenda software we use extended hours. Sunday 02:00 is stored as Saturday 26:00 - that way they're shown on the \"correct\" date and sorted in the actual order. We manage this by setting a custom \"start of new day\" moment: we have set this at 07:00, so 06:59 is stored as _(previous date)_ 30:59, 07:00 is stored as _(actual date)_ 07:00.\n\nFront-end display anticipates this (if time > 2400 time = (time - 2400)) - after sorting the times.\n\nI would really like to be able to use the power of Owncloud Calendar to be able to manage our gigs and share it with collaborators. When a driver wants to flag a date as \"unavailable\" it will raise an alert we need to find a replacement driver if on that day there is a gig at 26:00.\n\nCurrently if I enter 26:00 as time in Owncloud Calendar, it changes to 02:00 alright, but it is moved to the next day. I would like it to stay on the day it is entered - displayed as 02:00 and sorted after 21:00 instead of before.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/754/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "menerond": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/751", "title": "Subscribed ical-feed is not synced to other devices", "body": "### Steps to reproduce\n1.

to ownCloud! This is the issue tracker of ownCloud, if you have any support question please check out https://owncloud.org/support\n\nThis is the bug tracker for the Server component. Find other components at https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#guidelines\n\nFor reporting potential security issues please see https://owncloud.org/security/\n\nTo make it possible for us to help you please fill out below information carefully.\n--> \n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Create Calendar in Owncloud an connect this by CalDAV to Thunderbird/Lightning (but can also be reproduced on Android using DAVdroid)\n2. Create an Recurring Event in Lightning (e.g. recurring every second day)\n3. Sync to Owncloud -> everything is fine\n4. Move one of the Events one Day forward (e.g by drag and drop)\n5. Sync to Owncloud -> A new Event is created but the old stayed in the Owncloud Calendar\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe moved Event should be moved to the new Place\n### Actual behaviour\n\nA new Event in created (it's ok so far), but the old one is not getting deleted. The old one also seems to get touched by CalDAV because ist recurrance Settings are removed. Lightning Calendar also shows properly so Owncloud and Lightning are out of sync right now.\n### Server configuration\n\n**Operating system**:\nRaspbian Jessie / Kernel 4.4.9\n**Web server:**\nApache 2.4.10\n**Database:**\nMySQL 5.5.44\n**PHP version:**\nPHP 5.6.20\n**ownCloud version:** (see ownCloud admin page)\nownCloud 9.0.2 (stable)\n**Updated from an older ownCloud or fresh install:**\nfresh install\n**Where did you install ownCloud from:**\ndownload.owncloud.org\n\n**List of activated apps:**\nCalendar,\nAddressbook\n\n**Are you using external storage, if yes which one:** local/smb/sftp/...\nno\n**Are you using encryption:** yes/no\nno\n**Are you using an external user-backend, if yes which one:** LDAP/ActiveDirectory/Webdav/...\nno\n### Client configuration\n\n**Browser:**\nFirefox 46\n**Operating system:**\nWin10\n\noriginally reported by @waybackrider in https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/24591\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/562/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/540", "title": "Get rid of `this.` in models", "body": "`this.` comes with various issues in JS\nthere are much better patterns that work better\nlike: https://gist.github.com/georgehrke/be017eac7689c08a51b1\n\nFirst of all we should start with transforming the models\nand while refactoring we should also finally start writing tests\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/540/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/515", "title": "automate bower updates", "body": "", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/515/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/499", "title": "Show tasks with DUE date in calendar", "body": "- [ ] per-user config option to enable this feature\n- [ ] only available when tasks app is enabled\n- [ ] tasks have a checkbox in front of them, clicking this checkbox will mark the task as done.\n- [ ] clicking the task itself should take the user to the task app\n  -

Remove the txt postfix\n2. Import it to an existing calendar of your OC/NC\n### Expected behaviour\n\nImport without any issues as Thunderbird Lightning 47.0 does it and display the appointments correctly.\n### Actual behaviour\n\nA warning (!)  occurs beside the upload button which says:\n\"The file contains objects which are not compatible.\"\n\nThe calendar is not shown. Appointments of another calendar were put to Tuesday instead of Monday.  \nThe log states: `The supplied iCalendar datetime value is incorrect`\n### Question\n\nWhy is the error message only found in the internal OC server log and not shown to the user at the front end?\n### Further notes\n\nUploading and importing works with other calendars, eg. with those I created on Nextcloud,  downloaded and reimported to a new calendar.                                                                                       \n### Server configuration\n\n**Operating system**: Debian 8\n\n**Web server:**

"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/708", "title": "Events as tasks and vice versa", "body": "Hello,\n\nTwo (not that) small proposals for killing features. I think it involves also the Tasks app but as it seems to me that it requires more work from the Calendar app, I create the ticket here.\n### 1. Events as tasks\n\nI think having the possibility to mark an event as a task would be very useful. The main use case I see is the following:\n1. the user inserts events on some calendars, and marks some as \"tasks\" (e.g. \"buy more coffee\").\n2. those calendars are _de facto_ a list in the Tasks app and offer a view of the event that are \"tasks\".\n3. the tasks can then automatically appeared in \"**Today**\", \"**This week**\" and \"**Important**\".\n\nFinishing a task would cross the event in the calendar.\n\nOptionally, the possibility to switch the view to displayed the tasks either by \"planned date\" or \"ending date\" would be nice. A small \"star\" to display the task labelled as important and a small bar to notify the progression would be a plus.\n### 2. Tasks displayed on calendar\n\nThe rational is that we often have a huge list of tasks that we would like to do, without having the time or the possibility to perfectly define when we will start them. If I plan my week in the Calendar app,  I would like to take the tasks I already defined in the Tasks app to turn it into an event that would appear on the Calendar view.\n\nThe Task app already allow us to define progression, starting date and due date so I think this is just about a bridge between the apps.\n\nBy the way, thank you for you work on this cool app. It is very appreciated. :)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/708/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "oparoz": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/696", "title": "Full free/busy support", "body": "As a meeting organiser I want to be able to see if the meeting participants are available when I'm defining the time slot.\nIt should work both in the web interface and on remote clients.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/696/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "wrexroad": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/668", "title": "Remove TZID when making event all-Day", "body": "### Steps to reproduce\n1.

Just as before.\n### Actual behaviour\n- User A sees calendars A and B (B's calendar is shown correctly as a subscription in A's account) \n- However, User B does not see any calendars (neither A's nor B's).\n\nThis is odd. I could understand if the calendar had been lost, but A sees B's shared calendar just fine.

It is limited to ASCII characters. Obviously, the Chrome JavaScript engine replaces the URL with the PunyCode version, and Firefox does not. Thus, parsing the RegEx fails, the variable \"parts\" is null and the described behaviour occurs.\n\nI am no JavaScript expert, but this may be a misbehaviour of Firefox JavaScript engine.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/483/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "benedetto": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/481", "title": "Enhancement: add whole group as participants", "body": "Currently, if I create a new event on the web interface, I can add participants to this event either by their email address or by their owncloud user name (the latter is already a bit hidden, since the input line at least in German localization only mentions the email address). Since the app is obviously already able to contact information from an owncloud user, it would be nice if that would also work for user groups.\n\nSuppose the following use case: let's say we have an owncloud instance that is used to provide some services for our sports club. To keep things organised we have put the members in various groups, like \"active players\" (the ones who are taking part in trainings and matches on a regular basis), \"organizers\" (people who have some organizational function), \"dinosaurs\" (those who do no longer play actively for age reasons but show up and want to stay in touch every now and then)... One of the features we use is a calendar to have an overview about how many people are available for training sessions and matches and other things like social events. If I now create a new event, it would be cool if I could just add the group of people which are concerned with this event as participants by their group name to get them noticed about it. So, for example, the active players' group for trainings, but also the dinosaurs for a monthly summer barbecue.\n\nRight now, if I want to do so, I would have to enter all the participants one after the other by hand, which is obviously quite error-prone since it's easy to forget someone.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/481/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "bohni": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/480", "title": "Recurrent events in some months not visible", "body": "<!--\nPlease report only issues corresponding to the calendar for ownCloud 9 or later.\nThe old calendar, which is compatible with ownCloud 8.2 or earlier, is discontinued!\n\nMigration and CalDAV issues belong in the core repo!\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/core/issues\n-->\n### Steps to reproduce\n1.

In my personal opinion the colors shown in the image above (and therefore only the not uncommented ones) should be enough for nearly all use cases. The others were intended to allow the power users to easily extend the number of colors while maintaining a well founded selection of the colors based on color science.\n\nFrom a design standpoint even the colors in the image above are too much. A better solution would be to integrate a color definition tool. In the current calendar app there was a 3rd party app to fulfill that task (but not integrated). I was close to start some experiments to get it running when I noticed that the development moved to calender-rework.\nAt the end I could imagine to have a very low amount of default colors (e.g. one row) and a color definition button to select a completely user defined color. Maybe only the color definition button is enough. But I have to see it to ground an opinion.\n\nSorry, I did not know that with node and npm. I will take a look into that.\nBut it could take some while, as I do not have much spare time...\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/comments/159703232/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/comments/160278137", "body": "I would suggest this color picker: http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-minicolors/without-bootstrap.html\n**It is already included in the current calendar app as 3rd party code**, but not used.

Therefore I did the code changes like they are in this pull request: based on simple css changes. Regarding JavaScript and PHP, I have no experience coding with it (but dozens others like C++ or VHDL). Therefore I assume that I'm not suited to do that task. At least you would get more trouble than solution in that case. Also my spare time is extremely limited, therefore I would not be able to follow your fast development cycle. Sorry, but probably I will not of big help here.\n\nIn the future I will continue to write bug reports and create tiny pull requests (that get closed short after; but may start a fruitful discussion...)\n\nJust for the records: I changed the code in my branch to address the issues mentioned here. So in case you could not find someone implementing a nice color picker until release 9.0, you may consider to put this reduced color set as a temporary solution.
