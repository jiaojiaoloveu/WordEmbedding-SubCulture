So if it seems useful, please check it carefully before merging.\n\nCurrently, the time-related accessors like `FitnessActivitiesFeed::Item#start_time` return strings straight from RunKeeper. They look something like `\"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 13:28:59\"`. This is fine for displaying as-is, but not a lot of use for anything else. This patch intercepts the values before they're stored (in the `Model#populate_from_hash!` method), and coerces them into `DateTime` objects.\n\nThe implementation is a little more complex than it _needs_ to be, because I've tried to model it after [`Hashie::Extensions::Coercion`](https://github.com/intridea/hashie/blob/master/lib/hashie/extensions/coercion.rb), so we can easily replace this minimal solution with theirs, once a stable release is available. Faraday already uses Hashie, so it isn't a new dependency.\n\nCoercion looks like (from `weight_feed.rb`):\n\n``` ruby\nhash_attr_accessor :timestamp, :weight, :uri # etc\ncoerce_key :timestamp, HealthGraph::DateTime\n```\n\nThe `HealthGraph::DateTime` class is just a wrapper around `::DateTime` which knows how to parse RunKeeper-style timestamps.

The existing `:next` and `:previous` accessors work as before, although they're not very useful now that pagination is available.\n\nFor example, to fetch every item ever posted:\n(This would obviously be a very bad idea in production)\n\n``` ruby\nfeed = @user.fitness_activities\nitems = []\n\nwhile feed\n  items += feed.items\n  feed = feed.next_page\nend\n```\n\nThis involved a minor refactoring of the test fixtures.
