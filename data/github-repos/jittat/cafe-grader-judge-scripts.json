So I tried to modify the `compile` and `run` script to use `/usr/bin/python3` but it failed. `a.out` run smoothly (via terminal) but it didn't produce any output to `output.txt`. Here are some modification I'd tried out:\n- I've changed `/usr/bin/python` to `/usr/bin/python3` in both `compile` and `run` scripts\n- As in python3, `.pyc` file is created in `__pycache__` folder so I add some `cp` command in `compile` script to copy it to same level as `a.out` with a new name `<source>.pyc` (instead of `<source>.cpython-xx.pyc`).\n\nSo I want some advices or suggestions from dev team on how should I do to make cafe grader supports `python3`.
