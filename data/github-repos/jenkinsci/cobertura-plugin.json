When a matrix build first completes, I can click on \"Coverage Report\" and it goes to e.g.: `/jenkins/job/different-coverage-per-python-version/46/cobertura/` and it renders fine. If I wait a little while or I restart Jenkins and then try to navigate to the same URL, I get a 404 error (see error below). Something perhaps is being garbage collected? But I don't know enough about how Jenkins works to figure out what I'm doing wrong here.\n2. The \"aggregation\" I implemented is very dumb -- it simply takes the last coverage result of the sub-builds and uses that as the coverage result of the matrix build. A more intelligent aggregation might take the best (or worst?) of the results and use that as the matrix build result. What do people think it should do? And ideally, the above issue with 404s on the coverage reports would be fixed before working on this.\n\nError:\n\n```\n404 Not Found\n\nStapler processed this HTTP request as follows, but couldn't find the resource to consume the request\n\n-> evaluate(<hudson.model.Hudson@602b8db7> :hudson.model.Hudson,\"/job/different-coverage-per-python-version/46/cobertura\")\n-> evaluate(((StaplerProxy)<hudson.model.Hudson@602b8db7>).getTarget(),\"/job/different-coverage-per-python-version/46/cobertura\")\n-> evaluate(<hudson.model.Hudson@602b8db7>.getJob(\"different-coverage-per-python-version\"),\"/46/cobertura\")\n-> evaluate(<hudson.matrix.MatrixProject@4f7034d4[different-coverage-per-python-version]> :hudson.matrix.MatrixProject,\"/46/cobertura\")\n-> evaluate(<hudson.matrix.MatrixProject@4f7034d4[different-coverage-per-python-version]>.getDynamic(\"46\",...),\"/cobertura\")\n-> evaluate(<different-coverage-per-python-version #46> :hudson.matrix.MatrixBuild,\"/cobertura\")\n-> evaluate(<different-coverage-per-python-version #46>.getDynamic(\"cobertura\",...),\"\")\n-> evaluate(<hudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction@3392dc01> :hudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction,\"\")\n-> evaluate(((StaplerProxy)<hudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction@3392dc01>).getTarget(),\"\")\n-> No matching rule was found on <hudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction@3392dc01> for \"\"\n<hudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction@3392dc01> has the following URL mappings, in the order of preference:\n\nhudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction.doGraph(...) for url=/graph/...\nTOKEN.groovy for url=/TOKEN\nVIEW.jelly for url=/VIEW\nhudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction.getTarget() for url=/target/...\nhudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction.getDisplayName() for url=/displayName/...\nhudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction.getOwner() for url=/owner/...\nhudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction.getIconFileName() for url=/iconFileName/...\nhudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction.getResult() for url=/result/...\nhudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction.getResults() for url=/results/...\nhudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction.getUrlName() for url=/urlName/...\nhudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction.getPreviousResult() for url=/previousResult/...\nhudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction.getPreviousResult() for url=/previousResult/...\nhudson.plugins.cobertura.CoberturaBuildAction.getBuildHealth() for url=/buildHealth/...\njava.lang.Object.getClass() for url=/class/...\n```\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/cobertura-plugin/issues/comments/32772770/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/cobertura-plugin/issues/comments/32782758", "body": "I think the 404 is because I never write out a `coverage.xml` file for the matrix build so the result cannot be loaded from disk if it's not in memory.
