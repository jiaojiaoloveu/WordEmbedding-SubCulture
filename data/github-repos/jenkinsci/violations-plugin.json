I have been experiencing this issue with this plug in Jenkins.\n1. Start a build running on Jenkins which takes some time, and produces a violations report.\n2. Start a second build which will finish earlier than the first build.\n3. The second build will not finish until the first build completes.\n\nBecause the violations report cannot be generated, probably do to generating the line charts, until previous builds complete, longer running builds from before can prevent newer builds from completing. If you are using another plugin like GitHub integration, these delays the time taken to get feedback from tests, etc.\n\nIs there some way to disable the line charts for violations report and get violations reports concurrently? So build 3 will be able to finish before build 2?

For each technology we are using a coding standard. The standards are controlled by different tools (e.g. PHP_CodeSniffer, JSCS, SCSSLinter), which generate checkstyle reports.\n\nThe aggregation of these checkstyle reports in the violations plugin is not readable and clearly represented, because different roles (frontend and backend developer) can not find the interesting results in one overview. They have to search for their results in an aggregated report, which mixes different reports.\n\nI think, it make no sense to create a jenkins job for each report. It would be nice to extend the violations-plugin in the following way:\n- The violations-plugin should not offer a fixed number of report types\n- Instead it should be extensible: the user should decide how many reports he want to use\n  - For example: In the configuration menu, the user have a button to add a violation report. He can define a name for the report, which is also used in the graph. He can choose the report type from a dropdown (e.g. checkstyle, csslint, pmd, ...). He can define weather and status of the build and the XML filename pattern.\n\nMy english is not the best, so i hope, i was able to explain my vision in an understandable way. What do you think of my idea?\n\nUnfortunately i'm not a java developer.
