If the backing credential information could conceivably\nbe synced with another consumer of credentials, then use a common type.\n\nThe first test case is username/password. People like ldap backed sso. So\ndo not create a credential type to hold username&password because that\ncauses at best interface envy and at worst class envy. There is converter\nsupport to help roll back if you shipped such a mistake\n\nThe second case is ssh key because you likely will use the same key against\nmultiple services.\n\nI'm on my phone so cannot see what is going on here but I am strongly\nagainst every plugin and their mother implementing credential types:\n- confuses users as to which type they need to create\n- creates type envy causing inter-locking plugin dependencies\n- really just a hack around using domain specs/reqs\n\n\u2014\n\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-plugin/pull/45#issuecomment-91880053\n> .\n\n## \n\nSent from my phone\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/github-plugin/issues/comments/91881268/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/github-plugin/issues/comments/91909492", "body": "J\n\nOn Saturday, April 11, 2015, Kanstantsin Shautsou notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @stephenc https://github.com/stephenc thanks for your comment, i will\n> be glad to read some examplse/documentation of right credentials\n> usage/implementation (or maybe i missed existed).\n> \n> Sadly I am kept too busy on enterprise features to write up the docs I\n> have wanted to.

The user gets to select how much permissions to give the token. To my way of thinking a better way would be to have domain specifications and domain requirements that match the permissions that can be granted to a github token. That way users can put the tokens into the domains that match the permissions they granted.\n\nA username/password would have full permissions, while a username/token would be in a different domain. As such I am unclear that the token needs to be a separate type from the username/password. Things that would argue for a separate type:\n- The auth with a token being different than the auth with a password, e.g. when using a password you have to pass `Authenication: Basic ...` but with a token you have to pass `Authentication: Token ...`\n- You are providing a special API to generate the token (e.g. via a web flow)... if the resulting token behaves just like a password in terms of authentication then you would implement the `StandardUsernamePasswordsCredentials` interface but use a button or such to control generating/validation/updating the token and you would not display a \"password\" field.\n- Perhaps some other exotic use case I cannot think of right now.\n\nAbsence the above, I would favour not creating a special type for this.\n\nIn any case I think you need to look at creating some `GitHubPermissionDomainRequirement` and `GitHubPermissionDomainSpecification` style class(es) so that users can put tokens into domains that match what the tokens are good for.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/github-plugin/pulls/comments/28199354/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/github-plugin/pulls/comments/28199367", "body": "If you are providing a specialized UI to provide for generating/revalidating/regenerating the token, then yes the server that you operate against (i.e. \"the origin of authentication truth\") is part of the credential.

The GitHub hook message handling was failing silently for me with the current release of the plugin, and this patch provides the solution. I'm sure this is confusing some other users out there.\n\nIn master, GitHubWebHook now gets around the matchers in GitHubRepositoryName (which require .git suffixes) by using its own matcher and a multi-arg constructor to GitHubRepositoryName. \n\nHowever, the GithubWebHook action checks against each job configured on the Jenkins server with GitHubPushTrigger. The GitHubRepositoryName object properly constructed from the GitHub hook message by GitHubWebHook is being compared against those in a set created by GitHubPushTrigger.getGitHubRepositories() via GitHubRepositoryName.create(), which still uses the old single-string constructor and therefore the restrictive matchers. That constructor returns nulls and GitHubPushTrigger.getGitHubRepositories() therefore returns an empty set, which of course does not contain an object equal to the GitHubRepositoryName object extracted from the Github hook message.\n\nThis pull request neatly solves the problem by moving the matching logic back into the single-arg constructor.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/github-plugin/issues/comments/17959844/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/github-plugin/issues/comments/17960414", "body": "Before changes:\n\n```\nMay 15, 2013 6:00:11 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubWebHook processGitHubPayload\nINFO: Received POST for https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner\nMay 15, 2013 6:00:11 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubRepositoryName create\nINFO: Constructing from URL https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner\nMay 15, 2013 6:00:11 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubRepositoryName create\nINFO: URL matches java.util.regex.Matcher[pattern=https?://([^/]+)/([^/]+)/([^/]+) region=0,44 lastmatch=https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner]\nMay 15, 2013 6:00:11 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubRepositoryName create\nINFO: Object is GitHubRepository[host=github.com,username=openplans,repository=OpenTripPlanner]\nMay 15, 2013 6:00:11 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubRepositoryName create\nINFO: Constructing from URL http://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/\nMay 15, 2013 6:00:11 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubRepositoryName create\nWARNING: Could not match URL http://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/\n```\n\nThe incoming URL from the GitHub hook message is matched, but the repository name from the Jenkins job is not.\n\nWith changes to the regular expressions used for URL matching:\n\n```\nMay 15, 2013 6:03:57 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubWebHook processGitHubPayload\nINFO: Received POST for https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner\nMay 15, 2013 6:03:57 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubRepositoryName create\nINFO: Constructing from URL https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner\nMay 15, 2013 6:03:57 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubRepositoryName create\nINFO: URL matches java.util.regex.Matcher[pattern=https?://([^/]+)/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/? region=0,44 lastmatch=https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner]\nMay 15, 2013 6:03:57 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubRepositoryName create\nINFO: Object is GitHubRepository[host=github.com,username=openplans,repository=OpenTripPlanner]\nMay 15, 2013 6:03:57 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubRepositoryName create\nINFO: Constructing from URL http://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/\nMay 15, 2013 6:03:57 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubRepositoryName create\nINFO: URL matches java.util.regex.Matcher[pattern=https?://([^/]+)/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/? region=0,44 lastmatch=http://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/]\nMay 15, 2013 6:03:57 PM com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubRepositoryName create\nINFO: Object is GitHubRepository[host=github.com,username=openplans,repository=OpenTripPlanner]\n```\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/github-plugin/issues/comments/17960414/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "mnapoli": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/github-plugin/issues/comments/18539048", "body": "> 1.
