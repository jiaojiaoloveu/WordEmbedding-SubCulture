A kill request to mesos driver from the framework scheduler is delivered to the executor. The kill request by itself is not a guarantee that the task will be killed, until honored by the executor. So, it is possible that the executor can be written to achieve the \"graceful\" behavior you desire. The resources assigned to the task aren't reclaimed until the task is reported killed/terminated by the executor. It is possible, for example, to perform \"clean up\" or \"checkpointing\" as part of a task kill request. But, that can be tricky in terms of delaying the actual kill logistics, and therefore making the resources available. \n\nIf your question regarding a specific executor you are already using?\n\nIn case you are referring to resource oversubscription feature recently introduced, those kills are determined by an entity local to the Mesos agent node. \"Grace\" would be majorly influenced by that entity and less by the executor.\n\nOn Tue, Sep 22, 2015 at 9:39 AM, Jerry Lam chilinglam@gmail.com wrote:\nHi mesos users,\n\nanyone knows how to kill a task running in Mesos gracefully?

Therefore I set the CPU requirement to 1.1 as an alternative method to restrict this, \n\nI have tried 0.7.0 (fails completely with NPE) and 0.8.0-SNAPSHOT from a few days ago (nothing runs at all \"WARNING: Not launching mesos-jenkins-cef7d675-99b7-4ed5-b8cf-d5da02d07e65 because the Mesos Jenkins scheduler is not running\")\n\nI have tried jenkins-1.599 with the same result.\n\nThere's nothing useful in the jenkins.log when it crashes - the last messages on one machine last night were as follows:\n\n{{INFO: Disconnecting offline computer mesos-jenkins-b0365b1a-8d39-4843-bd54-5e39a3103894\nJul 08, 2015 12:41:14 AM org.jenkinsci.plugins.mesos.MesosSlave terminate\nINFO: Terminating slave mesos-jenkins-b0365b1a-8d39-4843-bd54-5e39a3103894\nJul 08, 2015 12:41:14 AM org.jenkinsci.plugins.mesos.JenkinsScheduler terminateJenkinsSlave\nINFO: Terminating jenkins slave mesos-jenkins-b0365b1a-8d39-4843-bd54-5e39a3103894\nJul 08, 2015 12:41:14 AM org.jenkinsci.plugins.mesos.JenkinsScheduler terminateJenkinsSlave\nINFO: Removing enqueued mesos task mesos-jenkins-b0365b1a-8d39-4843-bd54-5e39a3103894\nJul 08, 2015 12:41:14 AM org.jenkinsci.plugins.mesos.JenkinsScheduler terminateJenkinsSlave\nINFO: Terminating jenkins slave mesos-jenkins-2c08c203-9570-45d0-8bb8-bff24622d616\nJul 08, 2015 12:41:14 AM org.jenkinsci.plugins.mesos.JenkinsScheduler terminateJenkinsSlave\nINFO: Removing enqueued mesos task mesos-jenkins-2c08c203-9570-45d0-8bb8-bff24622d616\nJul 08, 2015 12:41:14 AM org.jenkinsci.plugins.mesos.JenkinsScheduler terminateJenkinsSlave\nINFO: Terminating jenkins slave mesos-jenkins-924ddaaf-5d06-4c93-8810-87cc2704fc7c\nJul 08, 2015 12:41:14 AM org.jenkinsci.plugins.mesos.JenkinsScheduler terminateJenkinsSlave\nINFO: Removing enqueued mesos task mesos-jenkins-924ddaaf-5d06-4c93-8810-87cc2704fc7c\n}}\n\nThis was in /var/log/messages at that time showing that java had exhausted system memory:\n\n{{Jul  8 00:35:00 ci14bldmst01v kernel: java invoked oom-killer: gfp_mask=0x201da, order=0, oom_adj=0, oom_score_adj=0\nJul  8 00:35:00 ci14bldmst01v kernel: java cpuset=/ mems_allowed=0\nJul  8 00:35:00 ci14bldmst01v kernel: Pid: 25076, comm: java Not tainted 2.6.32-504.23.4.el6.x86_64 #1\nJul  8 00:35:00 ci14bldmst01v kernel: Call Trace:\nJul  8 00:35:00 ci14bldmst01v kernel: [<ffffffff810d4241>] ?

Most likely one of the port is not opened.\n- Make sure Jenkins plugin Mesos Offer attribute is configured correctly for your cluster.

When I try to test connection jenkins reports an exception:\n\n```\njavax.servlet.ServletException: java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.Stapler.tryInvoke(Stapler.java:735)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.Stapler.invoke(Stapler.java:799)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.MetaClass$6.doDispatch(MetaClass.java:239)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.NameBasedDispatcher.dispatch(NameBasedDispatcher.java:53)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.Stapler.tryInvoke(Stapler.java:685)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.Stapler.invoke(Stapler.java:799)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.Stapler.invoke(Stapler.java:587)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.Stapler.service(Stapler.java:218)\n    at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:45)\n    at winstone.ServletConfiguration.execute(ServletConfiguration.java:248)\n    at winstone.RequestDispatcher.forward(RequestDispatcher.java:333)\n    at winstone.RequestDispatcher.doFilter(RequestDispatcher.java:376)\n    at hudson.util.PluginServletFilter$1.doFilter(PluginServletFilter.java:96)\n    at hudson.util.PluginServletFilter.doFilter(PluginServletFilter.java:88)\n    at winstone.FilterConfiguration.execute(FilterConfiguration.java:194)\n    at winstone.RequestDispatcher.doFilter(RequestDispatcher.java:366)\n    at hudson.security.csrf.CrumbFilter.doFilter(CrumbFilter.java:48)\n    at winstone.FilterConfiguration.execute(FilterConfiguration.java:194)\n    at winstone.RequestDispatcher.doFilter(RequestDispatcher.java:366)\n    at hudson.security.ChainedServletFilter$1.doFilter(ChainedServletFilter.java:84)\n    at hudson.security.ChainedServletFilter.doFilter(ChainedServletFilter.java:76)\n    at hudson.security.HudsonFilter.doFilter(HudsonFilter.java:164)\n    at winstone.FilterConfiguration.execute(FilterConfiguration.java:194)\n    at winstone.RequestDispatcher.doFilter(RequestDispatcher.java:366)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.compression.CompressionFilter.doFilter(CompressionFilter.java:46)\n    at winstone.FilterConfiguration.execute(FilterConfiguration.java:194)\n    at winstone.RequestDispatcher.doFilter(RequestDispatcher.java:366)\n    at hudson.util.CharacterEncodingFilter.doFilter(CharacterEncodingFilter.java:81)\n    at winstone.FilterConfiguration.execute(FilterConfiguration.java:194)\n    at winstone.RequestDispatcher.doFilter(RequestDispatcher.java:366)\n    at winstone.RequestDispatcher.forward(RequestDispatcher.java:331)\n    at winstone.RequestHandlerThread.processRequest(RequestHandlerThread.java:227)\n    at winstone.RequestHandlerThread.run(RequestHandlerThread.java:150)\n    at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:471)\n    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask$Sync.innerRun(FutureTask.java:334)\n    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:166)\n    at winstone.BoundedExecutorService$1.run(BoundedExecutorService.java:77)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1146)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:679)\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at org.jenkinsci.plugins.mesos.MesosCloud$DescriptorImpl.doTestConnection(MesosCloud.java:232)\n    at sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor248.invoke(Unknown Source)\n    at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\n    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:616)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.Function$InstanceFunction.invoke(Function.java:297)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.Function.bindAndInvoke(Function.java:160)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.Function.bindAndInvokeAndServeResponse(Function.java:95)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.MetaClass$1.doDispatch(MetaClass.java:111)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.NameBasedDispatcher.dispatch(NameBasedDispatcher.java:53)\n    at org.kohsuke.stapler.Stapler.tryInvoke(Stapler.java:685)\n    ... 39 more\n```\n\nI see the same results when testing from a local jenkins instance brought up with `mvn hpi:run`\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/mesos-plugin/issues/comments/25969920/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/mesos-plugin/issues/comments/27427309", "body": "This fixed my connection issue thank you.
