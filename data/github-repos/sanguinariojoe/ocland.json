I am working on clEnqueueReadBufferRect now, planning to make some tests and start windows port after it. I am not a fan of windows but cross-platform ocland will cover more usecases of OpenCL-enabled software.\nThe idea of separate data streams is reasonable, I would be glad to participate in futher ocland development.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sanguinariojoe/ocland/issues/comments/75543541/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "COLLABORATOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sanguinariojoe/ocland/issues/comments/76155151", "body": "Fixed in commit 1578c8b274c2a5af847c0274198e34034f415e0e\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sanguinariojoe/ocland/issues/comments/76155151/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "COLLABORATOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sanguinariojoe/ocland/issues/comments/342797091", "body": "Hi Alex!\r\nI have tried running LuxMark on ocland last year and it had hung too.

Very sad... However, there are some other alternatives you may consider (see below). It would be really nice if you give back some feedback about them here!\r\n\r\nVOCL:\r\nPretty similar to ocland... Theoretically you can just simply run your OpenCL program without modifying even a single line of code. Seems too old, probably is not working\r\nhttps://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/vocl/changeset/380/trunk?old_path=%2F&format=zip):\r\n\r\ndOpenCL:\r\nSimilar to ocland as well. You should give a try!\r\nhttp://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/pvs/forschung/dopencl/dopencl-0.4.0_r1731.tar.gz\r\n\r\nCLara:\r\nThe website is dead... I would say it is similar to ocland... Who knows...\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/clara/\r\n\r\nSnuCL:\r\nSeems very professional. However, I guess it is requiring changes on the source code, or at least in the compilation and execution process.\r\nhttp://snucl.snu.ac.kr/snucl.html\r\n\r\nVCL:\r\nIt's cost-free, but not libre/open-source\r\nhttp://www.mosix.org/txt_vcl.html/\r\n\r\nrCUDA:\r\nFor CUDA language... I can't even see the license, but seems they don't allows software redistribution.
