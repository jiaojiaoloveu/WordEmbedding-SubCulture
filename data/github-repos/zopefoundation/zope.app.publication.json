Either the called method returned a string\n    (regular or unicode) or the response's write() method was used\n    directly to write the data. Those models do not work well with some\n    protocols. Thus, now the publisher deals with result objects. Those\n    are generally not well defined, but for HTTP they must implement the\n    IResult interface.\n\n  + HTTP responses provide two new methods that make reading the output\n    easier: `consumeBody()` and `consumeBodyIter()`. Either method can\n    be only called once. After that the output iterator is used and\n    empty.\n\n  + The WSGI specification specifically has some provisions in it that\n    supported our use of writing directly to the output stream. However,\n    this method of providing an output is strongly discouraged. Instead,\n    the application should return an iterable. Using the new IResult\n    implementation in the HTTP publisher, we can now return such an\n    iterable.\n\n  + When a retry is issued in the publisher, then a new request is\n    created. This means that the request (including its response) that\n    were passed into `publish()` are not necessarily the same that are\n    eventually used. This caused some failures in the WSGI support. Now\n    the `publish()` method returns the used request and the request's\n    `close()` method does not unlink the response, so that\n    `request.response` is still available after the publish call.\n\n\nThere are several oppurtunities here:\n\n1. Support large file uploads and downloads without using up a lot of \n   memory.\n\n2. Use the concept of results for protocols that do not fit the simple \n   body response scheme.\n\n..."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zopefoundation/zope.app.publication/commits/f3827980f93a9fef3ac3fd21fc16c861d6c4d4f0", "message": "Some test cleanups."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zopefoundation/zope.app.publication/commits/70c4e4ea18e05ff25a6b12a5cdd7189a132b924d", "message": "Fixed little buglet."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zopefoundation/zope.app.publication/commits/793af306c826e1642093e767d81f05338cbf8c25", "message": "- Removal of Services. You can now access the adapter and utiliy\n  registry directly via the site manager's `adapters` and `utilities`\n  attribute, respecitvely.\n\n  + Converted Principal Annotation Service to be a utility. Added\n    database evolution code to convert all service instances to\n    utilities.\n  \n  + Converted FSSync Service to be a utility.\n\n  + Created the concept of a global site manager. The adapter and\n    utility registry, formerly the adapter and utility service, are now\n    managed by the site manager.\n\n  + The `zope.app.utility` package has been merged into\n    `zope.app.component`. The utility registration class is in\n    `site.py`. The utility vocabulary is in `vocabulary.py`.\n\n  + The `zope.app.site` package has been merged into\n    `zope.app.component`.

The local site manager also\n    does not know any thing about persistent modules anymore.\n\n  + Updated `zope.app.pluggableauth`, so that it will work as an\n    authentication utility.\n\n  + Restructured `zope.app.persentation` (a.k.a page folders) to the new\n    component API.\n\n- Simplified the registration framework by only supporting two states:\n  active and inactive. This allowed us to get rid of the registration\n  stack and the complexity it introduced to the site management.\n\n- Removed all presentation-related APIs from `zope.component`. This\n  included the removal of presentation-related interfaces and the\n  deprecation of all view-related API functions. One should use the\n  adapter API functions instead.\n\n- Implemented some initial deprecation framework, see\n  `zope.deprecation`. It allows one to deprecate methods and properties\n  in classes as well as any name in a module.\n\n- Moved reusable test setups/APIs from `zope.app.tests` to\n  `zope.app.testing`.
