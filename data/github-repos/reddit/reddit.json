I can't find `&&` in the Python regex documentation, and running `re.match(\"(a)&&(b)\", \"ab\") == None`. Does it not suffice to include both groups, one after the other? Is the `&&` intended to be in the CSS? Also, it looks like you may need some more `{w}`s to separate the parameters. For instance, in testing I found that `\"center&&center\"` is matched while `center && center` isn't.\n\nLooking forward to getting this out and seeing what people do with it. :)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reddit/reddit/pulls/comments/555862/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reddit/reddit/pulls/comments/564506", "body": "It looks like this adds the `/` radius-width / radius-height.

I like that your pull request (#300) make `/api/submit` returns the whole Link structure back as opposed to pieces of it. One thing I noticed, though, is that your commit returns the Link data without them being wrapped in a `{json:{errors:[],data:{}}}` block. Returning data in that way seems to be the pattern for all POST requests and it's useful to be able to assume the type structure of the response regardless whether or not an error occurred. Also, conditionally executing code based on `api_type` seems like something that's not preferred (as mentioned in #296).

While this works fine for `api_type=json`, one problem calling `jquery.insert_things` is that when `api_type=html`, `JQueryResponse` produces the following result:\n\n```\n{\n    \"jquery\": [\n        [0, 1, \"call\", [\"body\"]],\n        [1, 2, \"attr\", \"find\"],\n        [2, 3, \"call\", [\".status\"]],\n        [3, 4, \"attr\", \"hide\"],\n        [4, 5, \"call\", []],\n        [5, 6, \"attr\", \"html\"],\n        [6, 7, \"call\", [\"\"]],\n        [7, 8, \"attr\", \"end\"],\n        [8, 9, \"call\", []],\n        [1, 10, \"attr\", \"redirect\"],\n        [10, 11, \"call\", [\"http://reddit.local:8000/r/testreddit/comments/2b/test/\"]],\n        [1, 12, \"attr\", \"insert_things\"], # extra\n        [12, 13, \"call\", [                # extra\n            [{                            # extra\n                \"kind\": \"t6\",             # extra\n                \"data\": {                 # extra\n                    \"content\": \"...\",     # extra\n                    \"sr\": \"t5_2\",         # extra\n                    \"id\": \"t6_2b\"         # extra\n                }                         # extra\n            }], false]]                   # extra\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure if this is desirable since changing the output for `api_type=html` may break existing libraries. For example, I've seen libraries that parses the `api_type=html` JSON output with something like this: `result[\"jquery\"][-1][-1][-1]` (to grab the last parameter value of the last statement). This change would cause those libraries to fail. Also, this data really isn't needed by reddit's front-end javascript code because of the `redirect` call. If we can somehow avoid modifying the original output for `api_type=html`, this commit would be awesome.

And while I'm sole mod, I may well add more down the road.  I'd prefer _not_ having to deal with the confusion of explaining to each mod \"hey, this post option exists, we cannot turn it off, but don't use it\".  I've actually replaced the submit text with \"Don't even think about it\", as well as disabled the submission button from within my subreddit CSS.\n\nOther subs have far more mods. \n- /r/askwomen [has 25](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/0993abe324066a5c98c327336658c005e09dd4c3#commitcomment-6482396)  \n- /r/askmen [has 11](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/about/moderators).\n- /r/news [has 13](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/about/moderators)\n- /r/askscience [has 56](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskScience/about/moderators)\n- /r/askhistorians [has 28](http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/about/moderators)\n\nAt least two of these (Ask Science & Ask Historians) _also_ disable Link posts, largely for the same reasons I do:  posting a naked link without context makes for a really horrible discussion context.  Requiring a text (self) post contextualizing and framing the link(s) tends to be far more useful.  It's the model I'm familiar with from Slashdot way back when.  And if that's the model you've elected for your subreddit, having to monitor the sub to see that links _don't_ get submitted by one of your several dozen mods becomes yet another hassle.  And it's an entirely avoidable one.\n\nWhy not head it off at the pass?\n\nOne of the things I've learned in UI design and computer use is that the easiest way to avoid doing something you don't want to do _is to remove the option to do it_.  Or hide it carefully.\n\nIn my own sysadmin work, it's something I've used to my benefit:  doing disk of filesystem operations?  Make sure you've got backups, look at your commands twice, _and set filesystems other than the one(s) you're intending to affect to read-only_.  Yes, I do that, and yes, it's saved my ass a couple of times.\n\nAnd for large, highly-trafficked subs with many mods, if the choice is to disable link submissions, then offer the capability to do that _even for mods_.\n\nYou've _changed_ a previous behavior, and done it without confirming or even notifying users of it (something that pretty much always grates).

Clicking N children gets you to see the N children, much like a \"read here\" link leads you to an article, etc.\n\nAs @andytuba mentions, we're happy to just update it in RES, so my opinion doesn't come from a place of \"we don't want to have to fix this for RES users\", but rather standard UX convention/thought.  Ultimately, UX is part science but also part art, and if you feel it shouldn't be clickable we can always make an option in RES to allow users to restore that behavior.

For example I went to r/aww, clicked a photo, closed it out, then clicked comments. 2 windows open now.
