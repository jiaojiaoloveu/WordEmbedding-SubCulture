If you're concerned about your personal information, you're free to leave out the address and telephone number from a CLA. \n\nIn many countries, like the United States, your work is automatically copyrighted. Thus the code in you branch that you're offering for merge is actually owned by you and we have no right to it. In most cases, code contributions do not include a license as is true with your license. Because you're offering a patch to source code that is licensed, it is usually implied that you want your copyrighted code to be licensed the same way, but this is not explicit. The CLA makes this explicit.\n\nIt also provides a promise that the code you are contributing was yours, and therefore you own the copyright and the legal right to license this copyrighted code under the project's license. In some circumstances, such as if you were writing code on company time, you may not own copyright to your code. A current or past employer who hasn't agreed to allow you to write code and license it publicly on their time might retract that code. Since they owned the copyright, they could. The CLA protects against this by requiring the contributor to vouch that they hold free copyright to their contributions.\n\n@smarxmoxie I believe this ticket is relevant to this feature: \n\nhttp://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KNIFE_EC2-18\n\nIf it is, please follow up there with any discussion related to this feature so others can find it in one canonical location.

Since we're only interacting with AWS all we really need is fog-aws which depends on fog-core, fog-json, and fog-xml.  Here's the positive results of this change:\n\nGems we're no longer be depending on:\n\nUsing inflecto 0.0.2\nUsing fog-brightbox 0.9.0\nUsing fog-ecloud 0.3.0\nUsing fog-local 0.2.1\nUsing fog-powerdns 0.1.1\nUsing fog-profitbricks 0.0.5\nUsing fog-radosgw 0.0.4\nUsing fog-riakcs 0.1.0\nUsing fog-sakuracloud 1.3.3\nUsing fog-serverlove 0.1.2\nUsing fog-softlayer 1.0.2\nUsing fog-storm_on_demand 0.1.1\nUsing fog-terremark 0.1.0\nUsing fog-vmfusion 0.1.0\nUsing fog-voxel 0.1.0\nUsing fog 1.29.0\nUsing fog-atmos 0.1.0\nUsing fission 0.5.0\nUsing CFPropertyList 2.3.2\n\nLoad time of the requires:\n\nfog: 0m1.758s\nfog-aws: 0m0.682s\n\nSo we speed up our load time by a second and we remove 19 dependencies.  Also since we're no longer depending directly on fog, we won't pin fog in a way that breaks people that use other knife cloud plugins as we've done in the past."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chef/knife-ec2/commits/fec10cc7b64a03d37fe9155629d99247c8360d6e", "message": "Remove instance colors\n\nWe have hardcoded instance colors that show up in knife ec2 server list.\nThe colors are hard coded to incredibly old instance types.

"@btm,\nyes, I will be improving the comment and code as per your suggestion and have added tests also.\nWhen secret option is passed for Linux vm, instead of knife-windows, chef module is imported.\nIn chef code mentioned [here](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/data_bag_secret_options.rb#L43), when secret option is passed, its proc function sets the value using set_cl_secret method in `Chef::Config[:knife][:cl_secret]`.\nAnd later the chef code instead of checking if value is present in `bootstrap.config` also, it checks for value in `Chef::Config[:knife][:cl_secret]` [code here](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/data_bag_secret_options.rb#L70) \nHence only setting the s3 secret value in `bootstrap.config[:secret]` doesn't work, as only upon verification that `cl_secret` is set, the code uses `bootstrap.config[:secret]` value.\n", "reactions": {"url":

Any change should be based of that new code.\n2.  With which sub-commands  is this option inconsistent? `knife ssh` and `knife bootstrap` both seem to use \"verify\" rather than \"verification\" and I would prefer not to create an inconsistency with those core sub-commands.\n3.

Then I try running the exact same knife command and it succeeds.\n\nFrom what I understand, Amazon runs some initialization scripts (e.g. cloudinit and some puppet stuff) and one of the tasks is to configure ssh access for the 'keyname' specified.  Being that I was always able to connect right after knife errored out with the hostkey mismatch error, I figured that the cloudinit scripts were still running during the time knife detected port 22 was open and when it attempted to run remote commands to bootstrap the instance.  Other than actually running a command successfully before proceeding with bootstrapping, this was a quick remedy that I thought would help - to give the instance a few more seconds to finish up.  \nIn reality, the hostmismatch error still reared its head once in a while but not as frequent as before.  I just had a condition in my application to terminate the instance and try again 5 times when it errors out like this.\nI agree that this should be handled differently. knife should be doing a bit more than just checking that port 22 is open. Maybe in addition, it should check periodically to see if the server can run commands and timeout after a specified period.\nThe sleep statement was a bandaid that helped a bit but didn't eliminate the issue and should be removed pending a more permanent solution.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chef/knife-ec2/pulls/comments/7204403/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chef/knife-ec2/pulls/comments/8144057", "body": ":) Being \"nice to the server\" was considered.\n\nThe ready_to_run_winrm_commands function sleeps for 5 seconds after a failure to run the command, which seemed to be the pattern in other functions like check_windows_password_available.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chef/knife-ec2/pulls/comments/8144057/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}]}, "nubs": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chef/knife-ec2/pulls/comments/8165343", "body": "This needs to be fixed :)\n\nI also am hoping to see this feature get merged soon.

The `disable-api-termination` option will only get passed in the `server_definition` of `non-spot instance request`. Also, even if user set this option `disable-api-termination` in a `spot instance request` then he/she will get error as `spot-price and disable-api-termination options cannot be passed together as 'Termination Protection' cannot be enabled for spot instances.`.
