I don't think this is the right solution. \nIf the wrong events are presented to the user we should solve that in the python code. Not in the template. \n\nAnd the way to prove this is first to write a unit test that simulates it and when you have that you can write a patch that fixes the glitch. \n\nSee my [last comment](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=816174#c6) on the bug.

Basically, sometimes you don't want to add the order there because it slows down the query. This might matter when you're trying to optimizing some code where you rely on `MyModel.objects` but the sort order isn't useful.\n\nHaving said that, there is a way to undo the default sort order too actually. \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/airmozilla/issues/comments/41683492/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/airmozilla/issues/comments/41700491", "body": "I'm sorry.

It causes a ORM query for each event. We'll need to use a local \"map\" and use that to render here. \nSuppose we have a dict called `channels` where each key is the event then we can do this:\n\n```\n{% for channel in channels[event] %}\n....\n```\n\nThe way to get that can be to generate this dict in the view function and pass it into the render function. So currently we do something like this:\n\n``` python\nreturn render(request, 'search/home.html', context)\n```\n\nbut we need this to be:\n\n``` python\ncontext['channels'] = event_to_channels_dict\nreturn render(request, 'search/home.html', context)\n```\n\nWhat we want to achieve should technically only require 1 extra ORM query. We have a known list of events and thus we have their IDs so we should be able to use that to extract ALL channels that it touches. \n\nAll it should ever require is 2 queries. One to extract the mappings of events to channels. And another to extract the channels as objects. \n\nSo, to do this I wrote a new addition and added it to master. You're going to need this for this work and we're going to need it later when we possibly list the channels for each event on other browsing features. \n\nSo, what you need to do is pull down the latest master, and rebase your branch against that and then you can do:\n\n``` python\nfrom airmozilla.main.utils import get_event_channels\n...\ncontext['channels'] = get_event_channels(events_paged)\n```\n\nSee [this commit](https://github.com/mozilla/airmozilla/commit/7060eeb2d21f892886f0e71bbfd59f2a5e453068)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/airmozilla/pulls/comments/21483054/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/airmozilla/pulls/comments/21483099", "body": "I wrote that function, then tested it lightly using your branch and checked the ORM queries.

There's a reasonably big chance that there might be more than one which is the case when they have to re-submit a new video to Vid.ly due to some encoding problems or something. Also, there's actually a possibility that an event has a Vid.ly template but 0 VidlySubmissions. The only reasonable case I can think of is if someone has cloned an event and manually copied the vidly tag over to the new event. Or perhaps they made the vidly submission manually with some other tool. \n\nI think the best solution would be to assume that HD is NOT available. That's because I think 404 Page Not Found is more horrible than that a user has to watch the downloaded SD version.\n\nAlso, when you do that query on `VidlySubmission.objects.` you should also use the tag. E.g. `event=event, tag=context['vidly_tag'])`. \n\nSo I think the ideal solution would be to use a loop. Like this:\n\n``` python\nhd = False  # default\nvidly_submissions = (\n    VidlySubmission.objects\n    .filter(event=event, tag=context['vidly_tag'])\n\n)\nfor vidly_submission in vidly_submissions.order_by('-submission_time'):\n    hd = vidly_submission['hd']\n    break\n```\n\nThat way it works if there are 0 or more than 1 VidlySubmissions (by filtering by `tag`) it's extremely unlikely to ever be more than 1 but even if there is we solve that by sorting by submission_time and breaking. \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/airmozilla/pulls/comments/21987822/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/airmozilla/pulls/comments/21987959", "body": "We need to change this variable name.
