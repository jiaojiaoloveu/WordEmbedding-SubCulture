But I think you misunderstood what a addon is. An addon for firefox is an extension (I think you new that but let's be clear), https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/. Here we should give a list of addons, so I would say a list of file end each file name ends with '*.xpi'.\n\nI think that the Profile class we use can also take a folder name that contains addons - but I am not sure, and this won't do us any good from the gui. I think we should just allow the user to select one or more *.xpi files.\n\nDoes that help ?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozregression/pulls/comments/37180644/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozregression/pulls/comments/37327590", "body": "you can remove this function, since you don't use the table headers.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozregression/pulls/comments/37327590/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozregression/pulls/comments/37328012", "body": "please just name this \"addons\"\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozregression/pulls/comments/37328012/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozregression/pulls/comments/37328093", "body": "you shoud rename this function with add_addon(self, addon)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozregression/pulls/comments/37328093/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozregression/pulls/comments/37328357", "body": "rename to add_addons()\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozregression/pulls/comments/37328357/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozregression/pulls/comments/37328433", "body": "you could use http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qfiledialog.html#getOpenFileNames, so the user can choose multiple addons at the same time\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozregression/pulls/comments/37328433/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozregression/pulls/comments/37328541", "body": "remove the str() here -
