Historically we test the alphabetically last locale available, because rsync generally runs in alphabetical order... the thinking is that if the last locale exists, then the other do too. It's inherently a trade-off designed to avoid having to test every single locale individually.\n\nI read this as \"if seamonkey, and if it's version 2.0.5 or 2.0.6, check zh-CN. For all other versions, check tr\".\n\nBased on wandering around here: http://download.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/seamonkey/releases/ ... it appears that Seamonkey did indeed have zh-CN support for those two versions, and potentially a few others. However it was not consistent. 2.1 did not have it... 2.13 (current) has zh-CN and zh-TW. In many versions, \"tr\" was indeed the alphabetically-last locale.\n\nHowever, for the most part it doesn't matter anymore. The lone mirrors are reverse-proxying CDNs, not rsync-based. The logic of checking the last locale no longer holds any real value... any locale is just as good as any other. We still need to check _a_ locale, but it doesn't matter which one.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/pulls/comments/1869201/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}]}, "brandonsavage": {"issues": [], "commits": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/ef33e01317b18e7b26be9adabbfe966556c250cb", "message": "Merge pull request #35 from rhelmer/submodule-git-url\n\nformat submodule URL correctly"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/a55bd106fca0992f0d7775c637d0eb43f0991054", "message": "Merge pull request #33 from rhelmer/submodule-git-url\n\ndo not require ssh for submodules, for jenkins"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/897ab227cef9437c0ff6345f472008f838e1dc3f", "message": "Merge pull request #32 from brandonsavage/fixbouncerform\n\nFixes Bug 922281 - Fixes the API to accept and load an existing alias and then update it from the POST data, preventing an unknown error from occurring."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/6d00b8274253f66abbb7d500d9689f34e7399240", "message": "Fixes Bug 922281 - Fixes the API to accept and load an existing alias and then update it from the POST data, preventing an unknown error from occurring."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/533ebf1ba90cb33d876c8fa1fbd7e3fcf10eb502", "message": "Merge pull request #31 from brandonsavage/pep8compliance\n\nMaking Bouncer's Django code PEP8 compliant."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/3f889e17845b3d19fe7af2f7f151268c8d8461d1", "message": "Making Bouncer's Django code PEP8 compliant."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/226bcff66ef0069c58d6091e877c048033d498c9", "message": "Merge pull request #28 from brandonsavage/bug863381\n\nFixes 863381 - Creates a system for internal redirects of products inside Bouncer."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/c7bc42b8e0bbeaae6c7b0903bc0ddb0590757408", "message": "Fixes 863381 - Creates a system for internal redirects of products inside Bouncer."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/2ae112242638b4e653d20bfcdfe147c30a17a1b0", "message": "Merge pull request #30 from nthomas-mozilla/unset-check-now\n\nCustom action to turn Check Now off on multiple products (bug 907703)"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/1fcb0bb868065e17a1064d322eb45d17ab8a53ba", "message": "Merge pull request #29 from nthomas-mozilla/location-box\n\nWider location box to make it easier for humans to edit (bug 639389)"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/e8dc226a3d947d61a0c25b0f0ed2685096afe09a", "message": "Merge pull request #27 from brandonsavage/interface_update\n\nUpdating and adding methods to the Bouncer cache interface."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/226d71cfa6b85103aaf66631b6288e2d2afb92fc", "message": "Adding a robots.txt file - fixes bug 892189"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/be1cd57513b703414ed58948c21c33c1b1391b67", "message": "Updating and adding methods to the Bouncer cache interface."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/tuxedo/commits/e70fb4f413560d9198e85baf836f5b418fe0d6d5", "message": "Merge pull request #26 from brandonsavage/database-upgrade\n\nFixes 801687 - Upgrades bouncer database handling to use PDO.
