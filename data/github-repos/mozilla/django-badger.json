I'm going through pull requests and other things and trying to clean some things up to help @lmorchard out.\n\nI spent some time cherry-picking commits in this PR and pulled in all the commits except the ones that deal with the User model. I don't think the changes in this PR adequately address the User model. There was a lot in here and I pulled in a bunch and rather than keep this PR going, I think it's best to redo the User model related changes in a new branch based on the latest master tip and put that in a new pull request that we can collectively mull over. Sorry if that ruins anyone's day.\n\nI also fixed all the url tags in the badger_example templates. Now all the tests pass with both Django 1.4 and Django 1.5. Any future changes should work in both Django 1.4 and 1.5. Travis CI is set up to test in both environments plus I have a tox.ini that'll run all the tests for you if you type in `tox`.\n\nThis PR was a big help getting things squared away with Django 1.5. Thank you!\n\nClosing this out.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/django-badger/issues/comments/23202198/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/django-badger/issues/comments/23202226", "body": "I don't understand what this pull request is doing.
