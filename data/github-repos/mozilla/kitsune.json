We can re-eval when multi-Region becomes available but for the time being we need an alternative plan.\r\n\r\n## Suggested Database Architecture:\r\n\r\n - Replication in RDS using MariaDB is known to work well. \r\n - The Arch defines:\r\n   - A DB in **Oregon** as the **Master** database\r\n   - Databases in  **other regions** (currently Frankfurt and Tokyo) as **Read Replicants** of the Master database\r\n - Kitsune instances in **all regions** use [django-multidb-router](https://github.com/jbalogh/django-multidb-router) in **Pinning Mode** to route write db operations to **Oregon** while read operations get routed to the nearest Read Replica.\r\n - We need a secure tunnel between Oregon and other regions, using Inter-Region VPC Peering where supported or other method where not supported.\r\n\r\n![prod after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/584352/34943770-bc5a3e8a-fa05-11e7-9ed8-1b8667413846.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pre AWS Migration - Development Architecture\r\n\r\n - To develop and test the architecture we want to setup a minimal version with a Master Database in Oregon and a Read Replica in Frankfurt.\r\n - The Master Database will get populated with a recent anonymized SQL dump.

We sanitize the wiki content before we stick it into `Document.html` because that's a caching mechanism to keep the pre-rendered HTML around. But in general, we don't know that the destination is HTML, so saving content sanitized for a specific output doesn't make sense. Keeping HTML sanitization closer to output also keeps things consistent for security reviewers.\n- We only need to use `bleach.clean` if we _want_ to allow a subset of HTML. That isn't something we should generally assume: if we find a case where that _is_ necessary, we should be explicit about it, since we'll have to use `|safe` to render that, anyway.\n- Bleach doesn't actually _validate_ anything--it sanitizes it. Django is a bit weird, using `clean` for the name of the method from which you throw `ValidationError` but we're really talking about validation here.
