The debug logging should at least give a better understanding of why the moving was, or wasn't successful\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nCurator unsuccessfully shrinks an index. The error states that not all shards are on the designated node, but does not provide cause or steps for resolution.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\nI can only reproduce on our cluster\r\n\r\n  1.  Use the following curation action file https://gist.github.com/hansbogert/97d16b7c8fbb001d181b47ccddb9a638\r\n  1. Run `curator shrink.yml` \r\n  1. Observe above error\r\n\r\n### Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: \r\n    - curator 5.4.1\r\n  - Platform:\r\n    - Linux\r\n  - Subsystem:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Context (Environment)\r\nI'm trying to reduce the total amount of shards in the cluster. Shrinking did work before this cluster was actually clustered, i.e., it worked when there was only one node. Now there are five and it stopped working\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/1135/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "wfhartford": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/1133", "title": "Set default timeout_override for delete_snapshots action", "body": "When using the `delete_snapshots` action, the default timeout of 30s is not sufficient. Actions which have to wait for the on an HTTP request for the Elasticsearch cluster to complete the action generally have a long default timeout, `delete_snapshots` is an exception to that.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe default timeout for the `delete_snapshots` action should be sufficient for most common situations.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nWithout setting a `timeout_override` option, the `delete_snapshots` action frequently fails. Relevant log entries for this failure:\r\n```\r\n2018-01-18 15:57:15,962 INFO      Preparing Action ID: 400, \"delete_snapshots\"\r\n2018-01-18 15:57:15,967 INFO      Trying Action ID: 400, \"delete_snapshots\": Delete snapshots of active states of now read-only indices\r\n2018-01-18 15:57:46,005 ERROR     Failed to complete action: delete_snapshots.  <class 'curator.exceptions.FailedExecution'>: Unable to get snapshot information from repository: gcs_backup_active.  Error: ConnectionTimeout caused by - ReadTimeoutError(HTTPConnectionPool(host=u'elasticsearch', port=9200): Read timed out. (read timeout=30))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\nI don't know how reliable these steps will be, but I'll describe my situation.\r\n  1. Run Elasticsearch in the Google Kubernetes Engine\r\n  1. Use the `repository-gcs` plugin to store shapshots to google cloud storage.\r\n  1. Index a moderate amount of log data, we're collecting about 150 events/second totalling about 6GB per day, using daily indices.\r\n  1. Take frequent snapshots of these indices.\r\n  1. After a significant number of snapshots have accumulated, configure Curator to delete old snapshots. My configuration is:\r\n```yaml\r\n      400:\r\n        action: delete_snapshots\r\n        description: Delete snapshots of active states of now read-only indices\r\n        options:\r\n          disable_action: False\r\n          repository: gcs_backup_active\r\n          ignore_empty_list: True\r\n        filters:\r\n        - filtertype: age\r\n          source: creation_date\r\n          direction: older\r\n          unit: days\r\n          unit_count: 3\r\n```\r\n  1. These `delete_snapshot` actions will fail with the log entries shown above.\r\n  1. Add `timeout_override` to the options of this job extending the timeout enough to allow the actions to pass.\r\n\r\nRelevant log entries from a successful execution with increased timeout:\r\n```\r\n2018-01-18 16:02:43,311 INFO      Preparing Action ID: 400, \"delete_snapshots\"\r\n2018-01-18 16:02:43,315 INFO      Trying Action ID: 400, \"delete_snapshots\": Delete snapshots of active states of now read-only indices\r\n2018-01-18 16:04:16,166 INFO      Deleting selected snapshots\r\n2018-01-18 16:05:28,218 INFO      Deleting snapshot ssa_201801120407...\r\n2018-01-18 16:06:24,931 INFO      Deleting snapshot ssa_201801120411...\r\n2018-01-18 16:07:55,201 INFO      Deleting snapshot ssa_201801120455...\r\n2018-01-18 16:08:42,957 INFO      Deleting snapshot ssa_201801120459...\r\n2018-01-18 16:09:34,815 INFO      Deleting snapshot ssa_201801120503...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Specifications\r\n\r\n- Version:\r\n  - Curator version 5.4.1\r\n  - Elasticsearch version 5.5.1\r\n- Platform: Google Kubernetes Engine (linux, docker)\r\n- Storage Plugin: `repository-gcs`", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/1133/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "quintonm": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/1130", "title": "delete_indexes with filtertype age/field_stats throws exception on indexes without any documents", "body": "Example config:\r\n\r\n```\r\nactions:\r\n  1:\r\n    action: delete_indices\r\n    description: Delete log-message-* indices older than 7 days\r\n    options:\r\n      ignore_empty_list: True\r\n      disable_action: False\r\n    filters:\r\n    - filtertype: pattern\r\n      kind: prefix\r\n      value: log-message-\r\n    - filtertype: age\r\n      source: field_stats\r\n      direction: older\r\n      field: 'timestamp'\r\n      stats_result: max_value\r\n      unit: days\r\n      unit_count: 7\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nthe age filter type should exclude indexes that have no documents when the the source is file_stats\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nAn exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n11-Jan-2018 22:32:42 | 2018-01-11 22:32:42,156 DEBUG\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 curator.indexlist\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 filter_by_age:431\u00a0 Filtering indices by age\r\n-- | --\r\n11-Jan-2018 22:32:42 | 2018-01-11 22:32:42,156 DEBUG\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 curator.indexlist _get_field_stats_dates:247\u00a0 Getting index date by querying indices for min & max value of timestamp field\r\n11-Jan-2018 22:32:42 | 2018-01-11 22:32:42,156 DEBUG\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 curator.indexlist _get_field_stats_dates:250\u00a0 Cannot use query closed indices.

recommended.  Elasticsearch is not a file-system where records are like files.  Documents (or in this case, log entries) are stored in a complex, Lucene inverted index.  It's a very expensive operation to run deletes on a well-utilized ES cluster.\n\nFor example, imagine the disk I/O affecting a traditional RDBMS if you were to have 400,000,000 records in a database and you ran a query like:\n\nDELETE from DB where tag='my_tag' and type='my_type'\n\nThis is an extremely simple SQL statement, but the idea is that it's a full-table scan to create a list of documents to delete.  Now imagine that query matches 20% of the total number of records \u2014 that's the equivalent of feeding 80,000,000 DELETE statements to SQL.  It becomes an extremely expensive operation just finding the records for delete, then you have to delete them, and wait for transaction logging, commits, writes. etc.  What happens to disk I/O for your current indexing operations while you're running this operation?\n\nIf that were all that were at issue, that would be a fairly quantifiable amount of pain. However, you are running this sort of query against Elasticsearch and it is not an RDBMS.  First, off, deletes are not deletes in Elasticsearch, or at least not immediately.  A delete operation only marks/tags a document (in this case a log entry) for deletion.  Only on segment merges will delete operations be \"committed.\"  The default settings merge segments after every 5000 operations, or 200mb of data, or 30 minutes, whichever comes first.  Even after the delete is \"completed\" you'd have to wait and tell Elasticsearch to run the segment merge and/or optimize again (which is another HUGE pain point - If you've optimized the index running a delete by query is a bad idea) to make sure that the delete actually completed. This would also cause I/O delays if you were running this operation and another index was trying to index a live data stream.\n\nTo continue our RDBMS analogy, if I have a subset of data to eliminate, it's so much easier to run: DROP TABLE\n\nThe operation is nearly instantaneous and does not impact the system the same way.  The script provided here is the Elasticsearch equivalent of a \"DROP TABLE\" statement.  It is intended to delete an entire index.  This is the preferred way to eliminate old logstash indexes for similar reasons.\n\nIn this vein of thought it is also preferred that you separate dev and prod data into separate indexes, if that is a problem.  It is trivial to add a tag and/or a conditional in the logstash output block to send to a different index name (e.g. index => logstash-%{env}-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}\"), based on those tags.  In that way you could index to the same cluster, but with a different index name.  When you didn't want your dev logs any more, you could \"drop\" the index with this script as-is.\n\nBecause of all this there is a hazard in merging this feature and offering it to the logstash community as a \"safe to use\" product.  It can seriously affect performance of an Elasticsearch cluster.  It can be done, but it brings with it a lot of potential for hair-pulling and ranting.\n\nI will check with Jordan before merging any pull request for this.

I've only been with Elasticsearch for 2.5 weeks :)\n\nYour suggestion to feed non-matching records into a temp index is a good one for existing data.  Otherwise, it's still advisable to make a separate tag part of your index partitioning strategy.\n\nLogstash now provides a way to \"stream\" from a logstash index and do filtering/matching: http://logstash.net/docs/1.2.2/inputs/elasticsearch\n\nHowever, renaming indexes is less ideal.  You'd do better with a new index name, and then create an alias that points to that new index, with the alias name being the \"old\" index name.  That would preserve the index naming for you. See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-aliases.html#alias-adding\n\nThe logstash cookbooks are good, but community-driven (for good or ill).  We love contributions! (not so subtle hint)\n\nWe are so busy trying to fix logstash and create new features that we are not able to document many use cases.  We are also working on creating a professional training course.  Re-indexing in the way described is one of the use cases we will be teaching in the training sessions (and we only spoke of it over lunch today, before I read the most recent comments).\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/comments/27044576/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/comments/27045124", "body": "Good deal.

Within 10 minutes after UTC rollover, my Logstash has stopped sending data for the last several days.

If you had hundreds of millions of rows to delete from your database, would you run a separate `DELETE from TABLE where date<YYYY.MM.dd` to assemble hundreds of millions of individual delete operations every day, or would you partition your tables in a way that you could simply run `DROP table TABLENAME.YYYY.MM.dd`?  The strain on your database would be astronomical on the former and next to nothing on the latter.  In similar fashion, it's the same way with Elasticsearch.  While Elasticsearch _can_ technically do both methods, for use-cases with time-series data (like logging), we recommend dropping entire indices vs. the extremely I/O expensive search and delete method.  Curator was created to help fill that need.\n\nWhile you could store different types within different indices (e.g. syslog-2014.05.05, apache-2015.05.06), this gets very expensive, very quickly in a totally different way.  Each shard in Elasticsearch is a Lucene index.  Each index requires a portion of the heap to exist and be kept current.  If you have 3 daily indices with 5 primary shards each, you suddenly have reduced the available heap space for shard management by a factor of 3, having gone from 5 shards to 15, _per index_, not counting multiple indexes per day.  The ways to mitigate this (if you pursue this route) include massive daily indexing boxes and using shard allocation/routing to move indices to specific members of the cluster where they can have less effect; keeping fewer days of information; having more nodes in your cluster, and so forth.\n\n**Conclusion**: While it may be desirable to have different life-cycles for your data, sometimes it's just easier and cheaper to store everything as long as the longest life-cycle you wish to maintain.\n\n**Post-script**: Even though it is neither recommended, nor best practices, it is still possible to perform these search & delete operations yourself, using the API. Curator will not be modified to perform operations such as these, however.  Curator is meant to manage at the index level, rather than the data level.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/comments/44189484/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/comments/44224940", "body": "What is the output of:\n\n```\n$ pip list | grep elastic\n```\n\nOn mine, it looks like this:\n\n```\nelasticsearch (1.0.0)\nelasticsearch-curator (1.0.0)\n```\n\nAnd also, what was the command-line that generated the above?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/comments/44224940/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/comments/44233196", "body": "I'm not sure what to make of that.

Did you use curator to create the snapshot you're seeking to delete?  Presently, the snapshot functionality in curator is rather static in its approach: One snapshot per day, one index per snapshot, and the snapshot name is the index name.  \n\nEffectively, curator's snapshot delete expects the snapshots to be in the format that curator snaps them, and will not delete snapshots made in any other way.  That's why it can't delete an index named test_snapshot: it expected a snapshot named `testYYYY.MM.dd` with the prefix you provided.\n\nThe reasoning here is that this is time series data.  Once an index is \"cold\" and no longer actively indexing, it is never likely to change again.  So snapshot it, save it in that state\u2014_in a snapshot of the same name, containing only that index_.  My future plans for snapshotting are to allow for two snapshot streams: One just like the current (full, cold indices), and another that can snapshot the current live index or two until they hit that \"cold\" state.  The delete function for the second option would potentially allow for your present use-case, and therefore a more broad ability to delete snapshots by \"snapshot\" creation date, though that can be of mixed utility because:\n\n> When a snapshot is deleted from a repository, Elasticsearch deletes all files that are associated with the deleted snapshot and not used by any other snapshots.\n\nThe [wiki](https://github.com/elasticsearch/curator/wiki/Snapshot) shows all flags used with the snapshot command, and clearly the `--timestring` field is there.

It is provided as a nicety. \n\nThe problem is the wildcard.  See [this line](https://github.com/elasticsearch/curator/blob/master/curator/curator.py#L319).  I separate the timestamp from the full index name by pruning the prefix.  If the prefix is `*`, this line still sees it as a single character. It doesn't know how to discover the date in those cases (hence the error message that it can't discover a date).\n\n[The wiki page for prefix](https://github.com/elasticsearch/curator/wiki/Prefix) makes plain:\n\n> The prefix in this example is `logstash-`, or _everything up to the date string_ of `YYYY.MM.dd`.\n\nPerhaps I need to make that more visible.  The prefix is every character leading up to the date string, including the hyphen, e.g. `.marvel-` or `logstash-` or whatever else.\n\nIf you can think of a better way to isolate the date from the index name, I would be happy to implement/merge it.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/comments/51231419/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/comments/51260570", "body": "That's not a bad update for the help output, something like: \n\n```\nhelp='Prefix for the indices.

Fairly tricky to do _right_, and there will be a LOT of testing to make that repeatable without mistakes.  For instance, what about dates with no separator, e.g. 20140805?  Will have to think of edge cases and test it to death.  In all likelihood, I'll have to do character counts and step through whatever is given as the `--timestring`.\n\nI will see if I can coerce a way to do this and test it further.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/comments/51260570/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/curator/issues/comments/51343299", "body": "How does this differ from `--older-than 3` time-units?
