Really interesting question.\r\n\r\nAn example Domain use case could be the following:\r\n\r\nImagine end users want 2 different ways to instantiate a Book:\r\n- The \"fast\" one, requiring only to enter a name and an ISBN, the only mandatory properties on that Domain.\r\n- The \"complete\" one, allowing in addition to the previous ones, to also enter a description, a reference to the Author and more optional data at the very moment you're instantiating the Entity.\r\n\r\nBasically we could have something like:\r\n\r\npublic class BookRepository {\r\n  public Book createBook(final String ISBN, final String name);\r\n  public Book createBookFromAuthor(final String ISBN, final String name, final Author author);\r\n  public Book createBookForArchiving(final String ISBN, final String name, final String description, final Date edition, ...);\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nWith different \"create\" methods depending on the domain use cases to implement.\r\nInternally, they could reference the \"fast\" one to delegate base implementation and set additional properties for each derived use case.\r\n\r\nFrom the domain perspective, as far as I would understand it, we would have different Factory Methods from the domain perspective.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, in CDI we could use the @Describes annotation with Qualifiers, as there would be different methods that could implement objects of the same Class and we would need to disambiguate.\r\nBut on this example they're effectively creating an instance of the same Book class.\r\n\r\nHere is the \"user\" that selects (for \"problem solvers\") on (or follows for \"process followers\") each use case one specific implementation.\r\n\r\nAs current UI generated by Isis is more oriented towards \"problem solvers\", giving users the different actions, menus, etc. available, if we annotate in some way all methods that from the Domain perspective can be used to instantiate the Book class from the user's perspective, we can, for example, show all them to the user when a reference must be entered of a given class, allowing to select a previously existing instance or a new one.\r\nExemplyfing it, imagine we show on the modal dialog invoking an action, for each param that can reference a Book, a drop-down menu with all the previous 3 options, giving the user the opportunity to select an existing Book or create a new one right in that very moment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that behaviour (showing the sub-menu with known factory methods) can be the default one for all params in action dialogs, and perhaps it needs to be avoided by something like @Param(showFactoryMethods=false) - being the default value \"true\" -.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case, would you consider these factory methods a \"domain\" issue rather than a \"technical\" one - like CDI, where the annotation would inject new instances automatically -?\r\n\r\nDespite that, I never thought of using the @Produces annotation for this and think can be a good solution for the most common use case. \r\nThe equivalent could be then a menu for all Qualifiers for the @Produces associated with the Entity class.\r\n \r\nSorry for the extension ...\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/isis/issues/comments/337356212/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/isis/issues/comments/337470030", "body": "Hi Andi,\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re effectively factory methods, creating new instances.
