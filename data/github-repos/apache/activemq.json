From the context it looks like the hangs you are trying to fix relate to a client sending a command that requires a response at its root, even though the one you are targeting is RemoveInfo (ShutdownInfo never requires a response so a client would never hang on that).  However RemoveInfo isn't the only command that expects a response and so a client might still hang due to the code in question if for some reason the act of the broker eventually breaking the socket on close didn't kick it out of whatever stall it is in.  \n\nIt seems like a better strategy might be to just formulate a response to any incoming command that needs one if the state of the broker is stopping when the command arrives, and pass only responses when one is generated even if the broker isStopping is true.  Whether or not you returned an ErrorResponse for everything when isStopping is true is one thing to think about, do you want the client to just assume things worked or do you want it to be able to report an error indicating that the broker is stopping.\n\nAs for the change you've made so far, if you were to go with that I don't know if the array based search approach is necessary vs just adding a 'isRemoveInfo' to Command to go along with 'isShutdownInfo' and just doing an plain old 'if (command.isRemoveInfo() || command.isShutdownInfo()) to that code path. \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/258005163/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/258258323", "body": "Looks good, much simpler now \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/258258323/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/263717697", "body": "There doesn't appear to be any tests here to validate that this is still an issue, many fixes have gone into the codebase since this was opened.

Better strategy. Agree, I was looking at a minimally invasive change, but I like more what you propose. Will look into it. Comments like yours are the reason why I created this PR in the first place. Thanks.\n3. The array piece. That's actually the way I had it (except I used getDataStructureType() instead of isRemoveInfo()). The two solutions are somewhat equivalent, except to add another command, in the array solution you would just add it to the array, in the other case you'd add another clause to the if.

fine:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/3/html/Reference_Guide/s1-boot-init-shutdown-sysv.html\n\nSLES doesn't use runlevel 4, but it does use runlevel 2 for

The patch incorporates what we've done internally to resolve the issue, which has existed since at least 5.8.x.  We mentioned this issue to Johan at one point. \n\nLet me know if the proper way to fix this is to derive our own StandaloneObjectFactory-variant and install via the FactoryFinder.setObjectFactory().  It seems as though the thread-local class loader is succeeding but causing cast exception in downstream code instead of failing and dropping through to the normal class loader.  \n\nSee Jira issue AMQ-5873 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5873) for stack trace as was reported internally.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/118424527/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "Hauenstein": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/pulls/114", "title": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5265", "body": "This is a revision of AMQ-5265 -- the original fix didn't quite clean up all of the mbeans that MBeanBridgeDestination created, as [noted in the original issue by Tarek Hammoud](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5265?focusedCommentId=14527137&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14527137).  The key for the map used to track the ObjectNames was an ActiveMQDestination (which uses the destination's physical name for its equals() implementation) caused the inbound and outbound entries in the map to randomly replace each other.\n\nLike Tarek, I could reproduce this issue using 5.11.1 with two networked brokers (full duplex) with a client publishing to a topic.  After I restart a broker, the logs on the non-restarted broker show the MBeanBridgeDestination reporting many InstanceAlreadyExistsExceptions when trying to register the unintentionally-duplicated mbeans.\n\nPlease let me know if this makes sense or if there are any changes you would suggest (ex: is there a reasonable way or an example I could follow to add a unit test for something like this?).
