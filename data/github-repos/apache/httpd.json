They made a big deal about announcing that very fact.  Microsoft are members of the Tracking Protection working group and are fully informed of these facts.

Microsoft knows full well that the false signal will be ignored, and thus prevent their own users from having an effective option for DNT even if their user's want one. You can figure out why they want that. If you have a problem with it, choose a better browser.\n\nApache has a history of stepping in when vendors abuse HTTP.

Thus, removing an invalid DNT header field remains compliant with any regional laws. In any case, at the current time, implementations of DNT on the server are only speculative, since the working group has not agreed yet on a definition of what Do Not Track means and the requirements for server compliance.  In fact, the default of \"unset\" (ISSUE-4) is one of few things we have resolved (twice) -- the entire discussion of which can be found in the public mailing list and issue archives (see links in the Tracking Preference Expression draft).\n\nApache HTTP Server does not yet implement DNT (and makes no claims of compliance) because: (1) DNT impacts first party services differently than third party services and we have no way of knowing which one applies; and, (2) the sections of the specifications regarding server compliance and the tracking status response are still in flux. If we do implement DNT, the implementation would impact code throughout the whole server, and the workarounds for broken browsers might then be more subtle than simply dropping the signal. Browsers have chosen to send DNT already, in spite of it not having a proper definition and not actually doing anything for users, because it is easy for them to claim \"privacy\" while punting the actual work to servers.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the legislative approach for regulations because only good companies adhere to voluntary standards. I am personally in favor of data protection laws in the US, similar to those in the EU, but hopefully easier to understand and implement. For example, the White House initiative on a Privacy Bill of Rights is awesome for a political document; unfortunately, the people who wrote that policy proposal are not the ones who write US laws.\n\nThe companies that are participating in the Tracking Protection working group are the good guys\u2014the ones who actually will turn off tracking if the user desires it. What about the others? It should be no surprise to anyone that, as soon as a reasonable technical standard is established, the advocates will push for legislation to force adoption. That's fine with me, provided we have a standard based on user preference and user expectations, not one subject to the whims of a convicted monopolist. Contrary to what some idiots here have said, I like Microsoft\u2014they have good employees, a nice group of representatives in the working group, and are a Platinum Sponsor of the Apache Software Foundation and the over 100 projects we manage. However, their business is still a business, and occasionally their business side chooses to do things that are actively harmful to the Web. No business should be allowed to do that unchecked.\n\nTo the astroturfers who only joined github in order to spew lies about what is in the standard: I wrote that section. I know what is says, why it says it, and what that means. It has been formally reviewed by the WG several times to assure that it represents the consensus on ISSUE-4. It is part of an open standard under development, which means the right way to change it is to go through the working group process and request a change. If the working group changes its opinion regarding the \"unset\" default or how it might be implemented, then I (or someone faster than me) will submit a patch to Apache that corresponds to the new consensus opinion of the working group. Apache has no particular interest in what goes in the open standard -- only in that the protocol means what the WG says it means when the extra eight bytes are sent on the wire.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/httpd/comments/1828422/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/httpd/comments/1836065", "body": "If you are not a troll and want to know a little about Apache history, read Brian's chapter from Open Sources \"http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/brian.html\".

What started as a decent discussion on this commit has spiraled, unfortunately, into an almost useless set of ranting. I appreciate yours and Roy's comments on this thread to allay some of my concerns about this commit.\n\nHad I come to this thread around post #200, I probably wouldn't have added anything. But I want to let you know there is at least one honest, concerned developer interested in this issue (and I hope many more).\n\nI've always appreciated Apache from my youth as a developer and as my career progressed. Apache embodies the ideals of transparency, openness, community and software excellence that I hold pretty close. I'm reassured that this wasn't a brash commit but had discussion and consensus on the httpd mailing lists (where development discussion belongs). I've been lax in not following these discussions and this commit only came to my attention due to the pretty handy social aspects of GitHub.\n\nAs a developer who is completely not involved in the creation of httpd I rely on those who actually live in it to make technical decisions to continue to improve the server.\n\nOne thing I haven't seen addressed though is how httpd will deal with being non-compliant in dealing with honestly set DNT preferences in IE10. If there are users who explicitly set DNT=1 or DNT=0 on their requests will there be a way for httpd to allow these honest users to pass their preference along (aside from not applying the patch or editing it out of httpd.conf). Or are these users considered collateral damage until Microsoft correctly implements the DNT standard?\n\nI'm primarily concerned with how these IE10 users are treated by httpd; not whether Microsoft is or is not implementing the standard properly.\n\nI don't have the time to spend on the httpd dev mailing list, but I appreciate the httpd devs participating on this github thread. I just wanted to let you know that there are users and developers of downstream apps and services that have honest concerns for user preferences and app behavior who are completely unrelated to Microsoft and their agenda with DNT.\n\nPS- of course thanks to you for all the software you've written and thanks to Roy for all the software he's written.

The people above who have chosen to engage in an argument in a public, online forum by asserting that \"everyone\" prefers privacy over features like social network integration have already provided sufficient evidence to the contrary.\n2. Windows 8 is not a user agent. IE 10 is a User Agent. It is Windows 8 Setup that is capturing a user's preference to set a default DNT value in another application. Is the configuration presented to new users who were not involved in the installation of the operating system?\n3. DNT does not apply to user data captured by operating systems (like Windows) or closed-ecosystem network providers (like Live). If you are willing to believe that Microsoft is acting out of concern for end-user privacy, then I have a terrific program to sell you that will remove all that nasty spyware you have installed and make your internet really fast! Click here now!\n4. I wasn't involved in the installation of Windows on my work laptop. I predict that if I ever receive a Windows 8 laptop for work, and the default option still exists to set the DNT flag during Windows setup, my IT admins will have chosen for me. They will choose to leave the default, since they care only about managing security in a way that is convenient for them, and they couldn't care less about any abstract and non-specific impact on my user experience, and they certainly aren't paid to worry about complying with an open standard for the good of the community.\n5. All things being equal, adding more headers to an HTTP request will not increase one's privacy. It only makes sense to assert otherwise when taken in the context of an enforced standard. Thus, to claim the benefits of the standard while simultaneously acting in open violation of said standard can only result in the eventual nullification of said benefits. Because of this, Microsoft is essentially choosing to follow the path of a free rider, and that's one massive free rider. \n\nSo long as its competitors respect the DNT flag sent by IE10 along with every other browser, Microsoft can claim (read: \"advertise\") that Windows 8 and IE 10 are more secure than other browsers that default to an unspecified DNT, in which case Microsoft wins. If its competitors stop respecting the DNT flag when the standard becomes moot, Microsoft will be in a strong position to lobby for new government-enforced consumer regulations against its rivals, since the industry clearly could not be trusted to self-regulate. The only way to maintain the standard is to call out Microsoft by nullifying any free rider benefits and ensuring that they get stuck with the appropriate amount of blame for undermining the industry standard.\n\nEnd-users will remain largely uninformed about DNT unless it is put in front of them with a clear call to action. It's the responsibility of software vendors like Microsoft, Mozilla, Apache, Google, and Apple to conform to and _enforce_ these kinds of open standards if there any hope that they will last. Microsoft still has the market share weight on the client side. The only heavyweight large enough to hold them accountable on the server side is Apache, and this commit is simply fighting default config with default config.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/httpd/comments/1827262/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/httpd/comments/1827282", "body": "I looked closer at the screenshot of the express install (here: https://img.skitch.com/20120907-tu8m3msxk7sngf61188f8hxm7a.png) and saw that the line immediately following the DNT default preference states, \"Help improve Microsoft software, services, and location services by sending us info\".

They have already indicated that they consider Microsoft's method of setting the value during OS install to constitute a default preference. If no advertisers are willing to respect the header in good faith before it is even agreed, then the supposed benefit of Microsoft making the DNT configuration part of the OS install becomes irrelevant and useless for all parties involved, including users of IE10, and Microsoft may as well leave it out at that point. DNT will cease to be. It will become a dead specification with no industry adoption.\n\nThis is the inevitable result if no other intervention takes place by other parties, and Microsoft has had the opportunity to consider this outcome: IE10 users will not benefit at all from DNT unless Microsoft changes its method for capturing DNT preference, regardless of whether this change by@royfielding is kept in the httpd.conf files.\n\nAs to the correctness of Fielding to commit this change on behalf of the Apache HTTP Server project or even on behalf of ASF, I figured it would be good to find a mission statement to see if this use of httpd to enforce a draft protocol standard would line up with the philosophy of the project.\n\nHere's a snippet from http://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html\n\n'We realize that it is often seen as an economic advantage for one company to \"own\" a market - in the software industry, that means to control tightly a particular conduit such that all others must pay for its use. This is typically done by \"owning\" the protocols through which companies conduct business, at the expense of all those other companies. To the extent that the protocols of the World Wide Web remain \"unowned\" by a single company, the Web will remain a level playing field for companies large and small. Thus, \"ownership\" of the protocols must be prevented.'\n\nThat last sentence is a pretty strong statement that at least in terms of internet protocols, Apache has staked a political position, and it can be argued that if @royfielding is under the belief or suspicion that Microsofts approach to DNT is similar to its historical approach to implementation of open standards (\"embrace, extend, extinguish\") then this change is clearly made in the spirit of preventing ownership of a web protocol (DNT) by a single company. \n\nAs to the repeated insinuation (@markrendle ) that his status as an Adobe employee represents a significant conflict of interest that calls into question his continued involvement in the Apache HTTP Server project or the Apache Software Foundation, I'm sure that's something that only he and the other members of the ASF can answer. However, considering the entries he lists under \"Experience\" on his LinkedIn profile (http://www.linkedin.com/in/royfielding)  include \"Co-Founder and Member (Apache HTTP Server Project)\" and \"Chairman (The Apache Software Foundation)\", you'd have to bring some pretty conclusive evidence in support of your ad-hominem arguments for you not to come off immediately as an uninformed troll or fanboy looking to get some kicks in a good old-fashioned flamewar. \n\nEdit: added link\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/httpd/comments/1834300/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "review_comments": []}, "sunseraphic": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/httpd/comments/1827335", "body": "@adamcin \n\nApache is not the battlefield for Microsoft-haters to fight counter Microsoft. \nPlease leave the greatest OpenSource common internet middleware away from your \"jihad\".\n\n@royfielding \n\nFor you, dear Dr, it would be more valuable to push the REST concept to the industry than to involve(start) such dirty ugly political war.

That's just plain wrong. I've never read the full document, but the snippets above alone should be enough proof for this patch to be revoked. Layers between the user and the backend (i.e. server side scripts) must not modify the DNT header, no matter what. Yet this patch does that exactly. Let the page provider decide whether he wants to trust IE10 or not. It's his responsibility, not httpd's.\n\nI'm no lawyer or anything, but even from my layman's knowledge, I'd assume that this patch, should it stay in the code base, would open the door for lots of trouble for hosters using Apache httpd. If you use it, you might violate European privacy rights and regulations by invalidating the users' choice to not be tracked. I'm from Germany and if I'm telling a German company/page owner they have to delete any and all personal data they got from me, they have to comply. If I do that by enabling the Do Not Track feature in IE10 and you (in the form of the web server) change it back, I could go to court with this. I don't think any reputable hoster would like to risk such things, in the end dropping Apache httpd in favor of alternative solutions. This patch won't protect personal data, it won't improve the product and it won't help anyone. All it does is damaging the Apache Foundation and its projects, creating even more problems and possible legal issues in a field already having more than enough things to consider or comply with.\n\nFor me this is just another instance of that annoying \"browser fanatism\", where someone tries to force others to use (or not use) the browser of their choice, just due to some weird believings, ideals or simply hate. When Microsoft introduced their Tracking Protection, people complained about them not implementing DNT. Now they do and people try to break it, while complaining about it not being like they expect it to be. Serious? End it now.\n\nIMO this patch should be reverted and this \"private war\" be ended immediately, including the revocation of commit rights. That's not serious software development, it's kindergarten (breaking other kids' toys because they don't like your own favorites).\n\nEdit:\nJust to make it clear: If the user wouldn't have any option (which they do) and IE would just always say \"DNT = 1\" (which it doesn't), then I'd agree with you. It would be in violation. But even then, I'd take the issue to Microsoft and not force some option people might not be happy with. Maybe they picked it just due to that fact in the first place. I'm using IE9 at home and work, and I'll use IE10 as well WITH DNT set to 1.

I've already stated my position : whether or not MS is right or wrong, I feel this was the wrong way to deal with the issue. You should now aim at damage mitigation, pull the patch, and make some PR announce so that Fielding does not lose too much credibility with this wrong move. We all do mistakes, let's move on.\n- Do I want to talk about the proposed standard? Yes, of course!

(Section 3, Paragraph 1 doesn't mention having no preference, so only when there is a preference specified must it reflect the user's preference).\n\nIE10 provides all three options as available choices. The set-up wizard gives access to two of those (to have a preference either way), while the advanced configuration options provides the third option (to have no preference). It also provides no default (given that default means without user intervention).\n\nYeah, you could argue that MS are attempting to persuade the user by offering an easier route to select a particular choice. But the spec only says that you have to give them the choice.\n\n@royfielding - whether or not you and fellow spec editors think this is clear is irrelevant. It's unclear enough for there to be legitimate debate about whether IE follows spec or not. Apache's job is to GFTO of that debate, and this patch has no place.\n\nNow, I digress, but I would also suggest that the entire section 3 in the spec could be rewritten as follows:\n1. The user agent must default to: unset\n2. The user agent must present three alternative choices in all places a \"Do Not Track\" preference is available to configure: unset, DNT:0, or DNT:1.\n\nDepending on exactly what you want to accomplish, you could then add something like:\n- The user agent must not suggest a preference, unless that preference is \"unset\"\n- The user agent must not suggest a preference, unless the user agent is a special purpose user agent with the explicit intention to provide greater privacy than a general purpose user agent.\n\nIf you want to be really thorough, you can add the wafty 'controlled network environments' paragraph as well.

As far as the current Editor's Draft is concerned, this is clearly a violation to what is being said under point 3, no doubt at all.\n\nHowever, in the RTM, this option isn't set by a default, rather it was added to the privacy questions in the initial setup, meaning you cannot install Windows 8 RTM without answering whether you want DNT or not. There is no 'default' for the DNT header anymore, since you can't evade making a choice as user.\nYou could consider the \"Express\" mode a default setting, but then again, it disables Microsoft's own feedback options and data sharing as well as it lists \"Do Not Track is being enabled\" as setting it makes. From my understanding of the draft, this would be a valid method of determining user preference, as the software product (Windows in this case, to which IE belongs to) asks for your preference upon the first launch and the \"Express\" settings can be considered a \u201cPrivacy settings: high\u201d option, even more so since it's listed as being an option it enables.\n\nMaybe it would help to end this discussion if you could explain why you believe the situation as is in the RTM to violate the current draft. I understand that you're the editor and likely have the best insight in the subject of any commenter here, but I believe that many of those who you called \"trolls\" wonder the same thing. It's not doubtful that the situation in the Release Preview is against the current draft - but that's not the final product. The final product is having a setup experience in that the user is definitely informed of the state in which \"Do Not Track\" is, on or off - which is from my best understanding a user choice.\n\nHowever, if you voted on this commit and it was committed on August 11th, this certainly raises the question how this is chronologically possible. The only logical explanation in my opinion is that you didn't even took the time to review the situation of the final product but rather voted on base of a pre-release product which is possibly (and in this case it was) subject to change condemning the final product.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/httpd/comments/1839735/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/httpd/comments/1842009", "body": "@reschke An additional user won't be presented the initial out-of-the-box experience where their stance on DNT is being asked for. However, I think that if you've got a local computer where another user (being local administrator) creates a new account for a user, this would be a \"controlled network environment\" as listed under section 3: A user might be unable to install new software (if they're not being made local administrator), but can set his own DNT preference (IE treats this as a user setting inherited from the system - you can change it) or install a browser that doesn't require administrative privileges for its setup, like Google Chrome.\n\nThe question is what a \"controlled network environment\" is in this context. However if a \"public access terminal\" and a \"managed corporate intranet\" are valid scenarios, then I believe a local computer managed by another user is, too. A public access terminal is basically a computer another user set up and for which they gave you login credentials.\n\nLeaving that aside, the only environments where this is a questionable matter at all are multi-user computers one user set up and further users are added to the system. I believe this scenario is also permitted by section 3 as I said above, but that's not even the point. In the cases of enterprises, single-user systems, internet Caf\u00e9s, Windows RT-based tablets, and so forth this section is definitely not challenged. It would be simply unfair to ignore their DNT preferences because in some system configurations DNT might only be relying on an interpretation of what isn't defined in the first place, this obscure term \"controlled network environment\".\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/httpd/comments/1842009/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/httpd/comments/1845129", "body": "It should be noted that this patch is violating the DNT standard, too: \"Implementations of HTTP that are not under control of the user must not generate or modify a tracking preference.\" That's exactly what this patch will cause Apache to do.

If I make two options \"Privacy: high\" and \"Custom privacy\" which is what \"Express\"/\"Custom\" are after all, then where is the user choice not being made?\n\nInstead, this way of argumentation goes like this: Nobody will read what \"Express\" says and just press continue - but it's the same deal with for instance EULAs. If a browser made a selection box: \"Do you want to be tracked? Yes (grey, sad smiley) / No (green, happy smiley) (recommended)\" that would be perfectly within the demands of the section. You can call it a 'default' as you like - it isn't by the means section 3 defines them.\n\n> I also suspect that it spells doom for (voluntary) DNT as you can guess which interpretation the people doing the tracking will lean towards.\n\nTo be honest, I'm with the EC here: DNT should be an opt-out standard. Most advertisers are residing either in the US or in the EU and they could be effectively regulated. In my opinion, DNT as a non-overseen standard is a choice a lot worse than if there was a binding law. I don't see why advertisers would have the right to track you. - But that's just my personal opinion. It doesn't change the law as-is. And from current law, yes DNT is optional.\n\nWe can only speculate why MS did this in the first place: Was it purely pro bono? Was it because they wanted to weaken Google, Facebook and the likes? - We don't know. I hope ultimately for a legislation that will mandate DNT as opt-out, maybe no tracking being allowed until DNT:0 is sent.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/httpd/comments/1851078/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "review_comments": []}, "marijank": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/httpd/comments/1842444", "body": "I've been reading this all day, and I can't belive that \"Roy T.
