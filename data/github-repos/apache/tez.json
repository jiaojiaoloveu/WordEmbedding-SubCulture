(yes, no, not sure)\r\n\r\nQ2- Can you briefly describe the change and why you made it? (for example, checking parameter before calling the method to avoid a Null Pointer Exception)\r\n\r\nQ3- Can you give it a name? (for example, Null Check)\r\n\r\nQ4- Would you like to have this change automated by a tool? (Yes, No, Already automated)\r\n\r\nThe data collected from the answers will never be associated with you or your project. Our questions are about recurring code changes from the developer community, not about personal information. All the data is merged across recurring changes from GitHub repositories. We will publish aggregated data from the trends of the whole community. \r\nWe have a long tradition of developing refactoring tools and contributing them freely to the Eclipse, Netbeans, Android Studio under their respective FLOSS licenses. For example, look at some of our recently released refactoring tools: http://refactoring.info/tools/ \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nHoan Nguyen https://sites.google.com/site/nguyenanhhoan/\r\nMichael Hilton http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~hiltonm/\r\nTien Nguyen http://www.utdallas.edu/~tien.n.nguyen/\r\nDanny Dig http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/dig-danny\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/comments/20950878/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "review_comments": []}, "bikassaha": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/pulls/comments/16071903", "body": "LOG.Debug?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/pulls/comments/16071903/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/pulls/comments/16071974", "body": "Can these be the same object?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/pulls/comments/16071974/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}]}}}}
