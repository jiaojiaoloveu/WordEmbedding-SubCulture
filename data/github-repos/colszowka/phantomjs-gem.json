Though I can see a reason to do that, our screens usually are big enough these days for longer lines, and even if not I find a vertical scroll more readable than strings spanning multiple lines\n- Swapping out the type of string literal quotes does not change anything performance-wise in Ruby, so optimizing those is usually somewhat pointless.\n\nThanks again for your work!\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/colszowka/phantomjs-gem/issues/comments/16224973/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/colszowka/phantomjs-gem/issues/comments/16225309", "body": "Thanks, PR merged and new release should be shipping soon.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/colszowka/phantomjs-gem/issues/comments/16225309/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/colszowka/phantomjs-gem/issues/comments/16225594", "body": "Should be resolved in the next release\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/colszowka/phantomjs-gem/issues/comments/16225594/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/colszowka/phantomjs-gem/issues/comments/16277954", "body": "Quick update: For some reason the poltergeist spec started failing after either this or the update to 1.9.0 and I didn't manage to get it back running yesterday, so the release might take a little longer.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/colszowka/phantomjs-gem/issues/comments/16277954/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/colszowka/phantomjs-gem/issues/comments/22041714", "body": "Yes!
