Added another property called IsStreaming to\ndetermine if the response should be streamed. Added a\nStreamingQueryReponse class that will read each item from the current\nstream. IQueryRequest now implements IDisposable so that the response\nstream can be disposed by the application after reading through the\nstream.\n\nIn order to use any properties on the StreamingQueryResponse, you\nmust first iterate the result or call the ForceRead() method which will\niterate through the results creating an internal collection with all the\nitems. Importantly, understand this is essentially the same behavior as\nQueryResult (non-streaming) and may lead to OOM exceptions. Note that\nSuccess and HttpStatusCode can be read without calling ForceRead or\niterating on the response. If you attempt to call any other property on\nthe response object without call ForceRead or iterating over it, then an\nexception will be thrown.\n\nResults\n-------\nWhen IQueryRequest.UseStreaming(bool) is set to true, the client will not\nbuffer the entire response, but instead keep the stream open and read each\nitem on demand as you iterate through the results.\n\nChange-Id: I9683df27a0429dff49793ac3d0c3dd9d7f171851\nReviewed-on: http://review.couchbase.org/69677\nTested-by: Jeffry Morris <jeffrymorris@gmail.com>\nTested-by: buildbot <build@couchbase.com>\nReviewed-by: Mike Goldsmith <goldsmith.mike@gmail.com>"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/commits/730a5cb81c9731da6dfd57bd4f6590d57924af18", "message": "NCBC-1224: part 2 - IBucket level data structure methods\n\nMotivation\n----------\nThis is part two (2) of the Data Structures feature; the first one is\nNCBC-1060 and is an API of Collections that are persisted to Couchbase.\nThis commit includes a new bucket level API for various data structure\nmethods for lists, sets and hashmaps.\n\nModification\n------------\nAdd signatures for common data operations to be peformed on a data\nstructure: set, add, remove, etc.\n\nResults\n-------\nIn addition to the traditional IBucket key-value methods, there are now\nmethods which operate within the document on specific data structures:\narrays, sets and hashmaps.

I was just going to address this. I am actually considering removing most if not all the finalizers. The purpose is/was to ensure that resources (namely sockets) get cleaned up if a caller doesn't explicitly call Dispose, hence the GC.SuppressFinalization calls, but it might be better to remove them. If they are removed, I am a little concerned that at the OS level, the sockets will leak and not close in a timely manner.

Note that this is per node, so if you had 5 nodes and you maxed out at 500 connections then you would really be using 5*500 sockets! The problem here is that this creates resource demands on the CB server which can contribute to poor performance and even the app server. \r\n\r\nFrom testing we have found that in general, most apps perform with a much lower max 5-10 (up to 50) connections per pool.  Also note that the SDK has another IOService implementation called [MUX ](http://blog.couchbase.com/2016/january/couchbase-.net-sdk-2.2.4-now-available) which uses only 1 socket per node!

It will remain open in the OS for roughly the same time.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/issues/comments/61986948/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/issues/comments/307094684", "body": "Hi Jeff,\r\nThe commit message and code formatting changes are perfectly fine.

This commit changes to a round-robin\napproach. Additionally, there was a bug where if a Uri was not available\nthe client would try to use null; this has been changed so that an\nInvalidOperationException will be returned instead.\n\nModifications\n-------------\nAdded null check incase GetQueryUri returns null. Also added a round robin\nalgorithm to help distribute the load. Added ability to set custom\nQueryFailedThreshold in the config (Default value is still 2).\n\nResults\n-------\nN1QL queries will be sent round-robin to each query node in the cluster;\nif a valid Uri cannot be obtained, then an InvalidOperationException\nwill be returned to the application.\n\nChange-Id: I4b3ab3bdda0b7d6eea8eb06d6522a5098a2071c0\nReviewed-on: http://review.couchbase.org/71426\nReviewed-by: Mike Goldsmith <goldsmith.mike@gmail.com>\nReviewed-by: Jeffry Morris <jeffrymorris@gmail.com>\nTested-by: Jeffry Morris <jeffrymorris@gmail.com>"}], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "CowPanda": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/issues/comments/11726385", "body": "Hi,\n\n  I'm a beginner, It's maybe a bug or sample is not completed;  Open the Couchbase solution -->ClassLibary CouchbaseSample-->\n\n   Program.cs line 52:\n  ====================================================\n          Console.WriteLine(\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRequesting view all_breweries\");\n            var allBreweries = client.GetView<Brewery>(\"breweries\", \"all_breweries\");\n            foreach (var item in allBreweries)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(item.Name);\n            }\n  ====================================================\n\n  Error(Couchbase\\CouchbaseClient.cs):\n  ======================================================\n        IHttpClient IHttpClientLocator.Locate(string designDocument)\n        {\n            //pick a node at random to avoid overloading a single node with view requests\n            var nodes = Pool.GetWorkingNodes()\n                .Where(n => n is CouchbaseNode && n.IsAlive)\n                .Select(n => n as CouchbaseNode)\n                .ToList();\n\n```\n        var idx = new Random(Environment.TickCount).Next(nodes.Count);\n                    //if nodes.Count <1 \n        var node = nodes[idx] as CouchbaseNode;  //will throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException\n        return node.Client;\n    }\n```\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/issues/comments/11726385/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "ingenthr": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/issues/comments/17437156", "body": "Saakshi: all changes should go through gerrit for review, so I'm going to go ahead and close this here.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/issues/comments/17437156/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/issues/comments/166040271", "body": "Hey @antonmes, Jeff and I just talked about how to handle this.
