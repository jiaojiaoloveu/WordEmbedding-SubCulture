I decided to cherry-pick these changes into branch with minor changes, instead of merging all of them. I hope that's OK. You should  them now in cclib/cclib#432, and I'll go ahead and close this PR.\r\n\r\nHere are the details:\r\n7c4e658 - I think the `assertEqual`s that were there are stronger. However, I did create some helper methods like `assertOptDone` to make testing here easier.\r\n5fa1dc7 - cherry-picked\r\nfdecbbb - cherry-picked and squashed with previous\r\n303960f - cherry-picked and squashed with previous\r\nf1ce1ab - cherry-picked with modified commit message", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/langner/cclib/issues/comments/327411145/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}], "commit_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/langner/cclib/comments/5229658", "body": "Yes, I've tested the function and it seems to do what we want it to...\n\nOn Ubuntu/Debian:\n\n```\n~$ python -c \"from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()\"\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages\n~$ python3 -c \"from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print(get_python_lib())\"\n/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages\n```\n\nOn a CentOs machine:\n\n```\n~$ python -c \"from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()\"\n/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages\n```\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/langner/cclib/comments/5229658/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/langner/cclib/comments/5335153", "body": "With this the test scripts do not install on my Ubuntu box.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/langner/cclib/comments/5335153/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/langner/cclib/comments/7646390", "body": "I see.
