Oh the number of times I've found myself staring at the uninstall screen longingly...

It should be skipping that rule because that rule has &quot;required_modifers = static&quot; and this is a const field.\n\nIf I create an additional rule specifically for private const fields and put it before the static rule then everything works.

This was causing UI delays since all this work was performed on every step on UI thread.\r\n\r\nThis change removes active statement tracking from EnC manager entirely (see VSO PR [101738](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_git/VS/pullrequest/101738)) and moves it to the language service, which has already been doing most of the tracking anyways. The active statements are now enumerated lazily and asynchronously to avoid blocking UI.\r\n\r\nThe new design also removes some of the dependencies of the EnC Manager on project system and is part of longer term effort to redesign EnC Manager tracked by https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/18350.\r\n\r\n### Bugs this fixes\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/13276\r\nVSO [246053](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/246053)\r\nVSO [530575](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/defaultcollection/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/530575)\r\n\r\n### Workarounds, if any\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nMedium.\r\n\r\n### Performance impact\r\n\r\nImproves responsiveness during stepping.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression from a previous update?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Root cause analysis\r\n\r\n### How was the bug found?\r\n\r\nPerfWatson reported UI delays.\r\n\r\n### Test documentation updated?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nTODO: \r\n- [ ] Add more unit tests. \r\n- [ ] Vendors are validating the build.\r\n\r\n", "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/pulls/22611", "title": "WIP:  Use SymUnmanagedWriter from Microsoft.DiaSymReader", "body": "TODO: setup authoring of VS, msbuild and dotnet SDK\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/10637", "author_association": "MEMBER"}], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/154593548", "body": "@agocke @amcasey I met the author of SourceLink at MVP summit.

An API to get a `Basic Block` graph for a given executable code block\r\n2. Each basic block has:\r\n   1. A sequence of `IOperations`\r\n   2. A set of `successor` basic blocks and\r\n   3. A set of `predecessor` basic blocks\r\n3. This graph has following category of basic blocks:\r\n   1. A special `Entry` block, which is the first basic block with no predecessor and marks the start of the code block \r\n   2. A special `Exit` block, which is the last block with no successor and marks the end of the code block\r\n   3. `Intermediate` blocks which have one or more successors and predecessors\r\n4. Each operation within a basic block has following characteristics:\r\n   1. It represents a logical statement such that the operation has no type or constant value\r\n   2. It has no inherent control flow within it  (except possibly the last operation in the basic block), ie. all the operations within a basic block will always execute once the control enters the basic block. For example, all the loops, if-else statements, conditional expressions, etc. have been lowered to simpler set of operations with conditional and/or unconditional branch operations.\r\n   3. Each operation may map to a high level operation which has a direct mapping to original syntax or a low level operation with no direct mapping to original syntax (for example lowered code generated while synthesizing branch statements within loops).\r\n\r\n**High level design issues:**\r\n - [ ] Design the core API to get the CFG:\r\n       1. Exposed on semantic model?\r\n       2. What parameters does it take? Is the input an `IOperation` or `SyntaxNode` or `Symbol`?\r\n       3. Do we expose a CFG only for top level/root operation of an executable block OR allow users to request a CFG for any arbitrary operation/syntax node within executable code?\r\n\r\n - [ ] Basic block API:\r\n   - [ ] Should the last operation of the block be an implicit branch operation or an explicit conditional/unconditional branch operation?\r\n       1. Implicit branch proposal: Each basic block will have following additional fields to represent control flow out of the block:\r\n           1. `Next` basic block field to represent the target of an unconditional branch\r\n           2. Set of fields `(IOperation Condition, BasicBlock ConditionTarget, Boolean JumpIfConditionTrue)` to represent a conditional branch\r\n       2. Explicit branch proposal: Last operation of a basic block will always be an [IBranchOperation](http://source.roslyn.io/#q=IBranchOperation):\r\n           1. Add a new `BranchKind.ConditionalGoTo` to [BranchKind](http://source.roslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis/Operations/BranchKind.cs,8) enum and add additional fields `IOperation Condition`, `Boolean JumpIfConditionTrue` and `ILabelSymbol ConditionTarget` to [IBranchOperation](http://source.roslyn.io/#q=IBranchOperation).\r\n           2. Add an [ILabeledOperation](http://source.roslyn.io/#q=ILabeledOperation) at the start of each basic block, such that the underlying label symbol `ILabeledOperation.Label` will be the target of last branch operation of all predecessor blocks.\r\n   - [ ] Basic block scopes:\r\n           1. Do we want to allow basic blocks to contain operations from more than one source level scopes or not? \r\n           2. Do we want to expose a separate side data structure on Control flow graph that exposes a set of program scopes and the set of basic blocks that map to each scope?\r\n\r\n - [ ] Operations within basic block:\r\n   - [ ] Use Locals (and ref locals) versus special kind of Flow capture operations: When attempting to lower expressions with inherent control flow (conditional expressions, shortcircuiting expressions, etc.), we need to rewrite the operation such that operations within this expression that have been previously been evaluated are captured in prior operations. The result of these prior computed expressions need to be stored at some location and referenced in subsequent operations. We have two proposals to represent such capture:\r\n           1. Locals approach: Use synthesized locals for capturing intermediate results and `ILocalReferenceExpression` for the use. For lvalues, we can use ref locals\r\n           2. Introduce a special operation, say `IFlowCaptureOperation` which represents define or use of some intermediate result or lvalue\r\n   - [ ] High level operations versus low level operations\r\n           1. High level: Retain the high level operation tree for operations that have no inherent control flow. Each operation within a basic block can be a tree of arbitrary height.\r\n           2. Low level: Simplify all operations by writing intermediate operations within an operation tree into temp locals and then replacing sub-tree with a local reference to the temp\r\n   - [ ] List of operations to lower:\r\n           1. ILoopOperation and sub-types (loops)\r\n           2. IConditionalOperation (if statement and conditional expression)\r\n           3. IBinaryOperation (conditional short-circuiting operations and user defined)\r\n           4. ICoalesceOperation (null coalescing)\r\n           5. IConditionalAccessOperation (`?.` operator)\r\n\r\n   - [ ] Operation tree rewriter API: We should expose a language agnostic Operation tree rewriter/cloner API. We have public IOperation extension methods that call back into language specific code, which makes is tricky to expose such a rewriter. We need to discuss how we can accomplish this.\r\n\r\n - [ ] Release story:\r\n   - [ ] Do we want to put the APIs under a feature flag, say `FlowAnalysis` until we have validated the APIs with end-to-end dataflow analysis built on top of the API?\r\n   - [ ] Testing strategy and signoff requirements prior to merge into master\r\n\r\n - [ ] Implementation\r\n   - [ ] Single pass to generate basic blocks/flow graph while lowering the control flow operations versus use two separate passes, one for lowering to simpler operation tree and second for generating basic block graph from lowered operation tree. Former is more performant implementation, while the latter is modular and leaves scope for re-using the first lowering pass for exposing low level operation tree (independent of control flow/basic block) via `SemanticModel.GetOperation(operation level)` API.\r\n  ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24104/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 2, "confused": 0, "heart": 3}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commits": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/7d08ecde95027174fa766c612550934cb0fad93e", "message": "Merge pull request #24069 from mavasani/DiagnosticCreateCrash\n\nFix ArgumentException when creating diagnostic with effective severit\u2026"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/bb4c1876f42ead8270b5e2c2bd1fb02dc76b4cb8", "message": "Fix ArgumentException when creating diagnostic with effective severity error\n\nFixes VSO 547049"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/8f70a5287a5de6b651153424da9f70da07414c0b", "message": "Merge pull request #23794 from mavasani/Issue23775\n\nDo not allow source suppression for VS/host diagnostics"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/8d5adafc51235cde09d00a891f5c27f3e2df6de1", "message": "PR feedback"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/5c3dff5ba9c7905b8b194378acca7f0b288e366e", "message": "Merge pull request #23559 from mavasani/MoveToLatestPackages\n\nMove to latest analyzer/compiler toolset packages and fix violations \u2026"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/28732366a95aa6c57f7bcba9c8702567210a50c0", "message": "Do not allow source suppression for VS/host diagnostics\n\nThis fixes the UI delay from force binding all assembly attributes during solution load.\nFixes #23775"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/6697e045253bce5b812c7b47cd0a846e7b0f79be", "message": "Move to 2.6.0 release package"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/263a4634b16749960c6d2801d1b446b9b36d4cd0", "message": "Remove suppressions for analyzer bugs fixed in latest release"}], "pull_requests": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/pulls/24213", "title": "Add skipped unit test for https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24212", "body": "https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24212", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/pulls/24071", "title": "Handle nameof expressions in UnboundIdentifiersDiagnosticAnalyzerBase", "body": "Fixes #23667\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Ask Mode template</summary>\r\n\r\n### Customer scenario\r\n\r\n`nameof` is incorrectly squiggled in a lambda with diagnostics with the following error:\r\n`Error\t IDE1007\tThe name 'nameof' does not exist in the current context.`.

We should provide a more stable and documented way to do that.  \r\n\r\nRelying on essentially a bug that is triggered by unstable condition such as absence of IL locals is not a maintainable strategy anyways.\r\n\r\nProposal: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/skip-localsinit.md", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/23951/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}], "commits": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/d0ccd99cec8e1c3d19139dead257df8950ce0181", "message": "Merge pull request #24164 from VSadov/blockIn\n\nBlock use of  explicit `in` arguments in dynamically dispatched expressions."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/54f324bbacfb8d9c6350273470aab7bad7888e6c", "message": "Merge pull request #24200 from dotnet/merges/dev15.6.x-to-master-20180112-080018\n\nMerge dev15.6.x to master"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/6ab2391a3acd4c046eacf30b0be3f2478f0ddb88", "message": "Added more tests"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/28b182d89ebcdac76c37bb84e9d0ec65b38a9b5e", "message": "added a test with two arguments"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/8cc031276414977b79e604c4e2cf9d6670a15783", "message": "Merge pull request #24166 from dotnet/merges/dev15.6.x-to-master-20180111-080017\n\nMerge dev15.6.x to master"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/commits/831323c19c9ef4172a5e0f783d9be57785233363", "message": "A better error message.

Now, on top of Regex support in the IDE we also support JSON strings.\r\n\r\nThis also expands the previous interaction model with built in json detection for string tokens.  i.e., if we see:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4564579/34694351-a0eb7324-f47b-11e7-8bfb-2a8f96b12d97.png)\r\n\r\nThen we'll offer:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4564579/34697518-5a0dc490-f488-11e7-8bfd-bc76633d6711.png)\r\n\r\nThis then helps users see how they can add a comment that lights-up IDE features for these types of strings.

Json.net allows a superset of standard json strings (including allowing things like comments, as well as other constructs that would normally be errors in es6 json).  \r\n3.

So i decided to scratch an itch that came up when discussing things over here: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/371\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces support in the Roslyn IDE for improved features for users working with .Net regexes.  Specifically, the intent of this PR is to support the following (entirely optional) features around regexes:\r\n\r\n1. Colorization.  Users should be able to write a regex and have it colorized automatically, with a set of colors they can customize if they want.\r\n2. Highlighting.  Users should be able to place their cursor on something like a brace and have the matching brace highlighted.  This should extend to complex regex concepts (like backreferences) as well.\r\n3. Syntax errors.  Users should see syntax errors directly in the editor and error list without having to compile or run their program.\r\n4. Fixes.  Errors in the regex should come with potential fixes to address the problem immediately.\r\n5. Suggestions.  The IDE should be able to suggest completely safe refactorings to a users regex to simplify it.  For example, suggesting that ```\"(a)(b)\"``` be simplified directly to ```ab```.\r\n\r\nHowever, supporting regexes is complicated by how regexes are supported in the language today.  Specifically because of the complexity present in how VB and C# escape values in strings on top of how complex .net regexes are as well.  To deal with that, two new components have been added to Roslyn.\r\n  \r\nThe first subsystem is called the VirtualCharService deals with the following issue.  To the final .net regex, the following snippets of code appear completely identical to it:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n\"\\\\1\"       // In a normal string, we have to escape the \\\r\n@\"\\1\"       // But not in a verbatim string\r\n\"\\\\\\u0031\"  // The '1' could be escaped\r\n\"\\\\u005c1\"  // Even the backslash *itself* may be escaped\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are all ways of writing the ```\\1``` regex.\r\n\r\nIn other words, C# allows a wide variety of input strings to all compile down to the same final 'value' (or 'ValueText') that the regex engine will finally see.  This is a major issue as it means that any data reported by the regex engine must be accurate with respect to the text as the user wrote it.  For example, in all of the equivalent cases above, there is the same error \"Reference to undefined group number 1\".  However, for each form the user wrote, it's necessary to understand what the right value is to highlight as the problem. i.e.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4564579/34459671-5bb785b2-edab-11e7-8413-79c331ef373f.png)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4564579/34459672-6deb88dc-edab-11e7-8236-7ba7cd331247.png)\r\n\r\nSo, the purpose of the VirtualCharService is to translate all of the above pieces of user code to the same final set of characters the regex engine will see (specifically ```\\``` and ```1```) while **also** maintaining the knowledge of where those characters came from (for example, that ```1``` came from ```\\u0031``` in the last example).  In essence, the VirtualCharService is able to produce the ValueText for any string literal, while having a mapping back from each character in the ValueText back to the original source span of the document that formed this.\r\n\r\nWith the VirtualCharService user code can be translated into a common format that then can be processed uniformly.  This means that the part of the system that actually tries to understand the regex does not need to know about the differences between ```@\"\"``` and ```\"\"``` strings, or the differences between C# and VB.  It also means that it can be used by any roslyn language (for example, F#) if that is so desired.\r\n\r\nThe second service is the actual regex parser that consumes the results of the VirtualCharService.  The regex parser is a fork of the real .net regex parser (from  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Text.RegularExpressions/src/System/Text/RegularExpressions/RegexParser.cs) however, changed heavily. The reason for this is that the existing regex parser is ill suited for all the needs an IDE has.  Major problems the existing parser has are:\r\n\r\n1. It is not error tolerant.  With the first error it encounters it completely bails out.  This would mean that the roslyn services would only work if the regex was written completely properly.\r\n2. it does not produce a usable tree by IDE standards.  While it does produce a tree, it is an extremely abstract one that not only does not contain much of the information that would be needed. It is also heavily processed and changed as parsing happens.  i.e. the parser will actually merge, split, erase, and even reorder nodes within the tree.\r\n3. it works with data formats that are intended to work extremely fast and efficiently when actually performing matching of regexes, but which would be very baroque and unpleasant for editing scenarios.  For example, it compresses data into a compact binary format, which it then stores in strings themselves that it intersperses with chunks of the original string.\r\n4. It will actually crash when passed in some strings (i was able to get index-out-of-bounds and even null-refs when using it).\r\n5. It can use excessive amounts of memory (even OOMing) just when parsing.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the existing parser does have certain things going for it.  Namely, it is the source of truth in the .net world.  It doesn't matter what the docs say on how .net regexes work and are parsed.  At the end of they day, this is the parser used, so it must always be deferred to when determining what is a syntactically legal regex and what isn't.\r\n\r\nThe regex parser this PR adds introduces a system far more in line with how other roslyn parsers work.  Namely, the tree it produces is immutable and fully represents all the characters in the original token.  The tree also follows roslyn invariants around nodes, tokens and trivia.  Ideally, the tree would literally be built on the syntax classes defined at the Microsoft.CodeAnalysis layer.  However, they contain internals that make them only implementable at the C# and Vb layers.  Because of that, the tree produces by the new regex parser follows the spirit of the Roslyn syntax model even if it can't fit into it perfectly.\r\n\r\nThis parser has been extensively tested and comes with 750 *seed* cases that validate it.  These are called 'test seeds' as the inputs to the engine are then mutated heavily to produce even more cases to validate the engine with (for example, testing all prefixes and suffixes of every test case to ensure no crashes or infinite loops occur).  Validation is very stringent.  All cases must parse without any problems, producing trees that abide by all roslyn invariants.  **Furthermore**, all cases validate that the new parser does not produce errors if the native parser does not.  Conversely, if the native parser produces an error, the new parser must produce **the same error** as it does.  That means that we do not even define *new* messages to show the user.  Instead, we use the same message (or message fragment) that the native regex parser gives the user.  For example:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4564579/34459743-084b2d4a-edae-11e7-9941-2e5df87e7fb7.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4564579/34459744-12d309cc-edae-11e7-8f3c-996bd684ba99.png)\r\n\r\nBecause of this validation, it's very easy to feed in new tests into the system and have it validate that the roslyn regex parser is working in line with the native parser. \r\n\r\nThe test suite currently contains all the existing positive and negative tests from the existing .net regex suite, as well as many edge cases i added while writing the new parser.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nHere's the current worklist for this feature:\r\n\r\nRequired:\r\n- [x] Create VirtualCharService system \r\n- [x] Implement VirtualCharService for C#\r\n- [x] Test VirtualCharService for C#\r\n- [x] Implement VirtualCharService for VB\r\n- [x] Test VirtualCharService for VB\r\n- [x] Create regular expression parser that will produce a Roslyn tree for a regex.\r\n- [x] Test regular expression parser\r\n- [x] Add stack overflow safeguards for regex parsing.\r\n- [x] Add diagnostic analyzer that parses regexes and reports warnings for issues as Diagnostics.\r\n- [x] Add tests for regex squiggles\r\n- [x] Add colorizer and fonts/colors entries for regex components.\r\n- [x] Add tests for regex colorizer\r\n- [x] Add user facing options to disable language services for regexs.\r\n- [x] Add way to apply this system to non-obvious regexes.

This can be frustrating, as shown in the code below.  I [asked](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45120852/editorconfig-const-enum-settings-not-working-in-visual-studio) about this on StackOverflow a while back, and nobody had a legitimate solution, so I figured I'd raise an Issue.  If this is not the correct repo for .NET .editorconfig settings, please direct me to the correct one.\r\n\r\nConsider the following .editorconfig (the more complete file that I use is available [here](https://github.com/DanwareCreations/VsEditorConfig/blob/master/.editorconfig)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    # Require const fields to be all upper-case\r\n    dotnet_naming_symbols.const_fields.applicable_accessibilities = *\r\n    dotnet_naming_symbols.const_fields.required_modifiers = const\r\n    dotnet_naming_rule.const_fields.symbols = const_fields\r\n    dotnet_naming_rule.const_fields.style = all_upper\r\n    dotnet_naming_rule.const_fields.severity = warning\r\n\r\n    # Require enums to be Pascal case\r\n    dotnet_naming_symbols.enums.applicable_kinds = enum\r\n    dotnet_naming_rule.enums.symbols = enums\r\n    dotnet_naming_rule.enums.style = pascal_case\r\n    dotnet_naming_rule.enums.severity = warning\r\n\r\n    #Naming styles\r\n    dotnet_naming_style.all_upper.capitalization = all_upper\r\n    dotnet_naming_style.pascal_case.capitalization = pascal_case\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the following C# code.  The in-line comments represent the warnings shown after \"`Naming rule violation:`\" in Visual Studio:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n    public class DerpClass {\r\n        public const int DERP = 5;      // OKAY\r\n        public const int Derp = 5;      // These words cannot contain lower case characters: Derp\r\n    }\r\n    public enum EnumLower {\r\n        val                             // These words cannot contain lower case characters: val\r\n    }\r\n    public enum EnumPascal {\r\n        Val                             // These words cannot contain lower case characters: Val\r\n    }\r\n    public enum EnumUpper {\r\n        VAL                             // OKAY\r\n    }\r\n    public enum derpenum {              // These words must begin with upper case characters: derpenum\r\n        VAL\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the `enums` naming rule applies only to the _name_ of enum types, not to their values.  Instead, enum values share the `const_fields` naming rule with `const` fields.  This is frustrating, as I either have to make my enumerated values all-upper-case or make my const fields Pascal-case, neither of which follows typical naming conventions for a C-based language.  But it's either that or deal with a million `Naming rule violation` warnings throughout my codebase (or Messages, if I change `severity`).\r\n\r\nSince the `enum` `applicable_kind` value is clearly meant for enum _type_ names, similar to the `class` and `struct` kinds, it would be great if there were another `applicable_kind` for enumerated values, say `enum_value`.  That way, enum types, enum values, and const fields could all have their own naming styles.  If the Roslyn compiler really treats enum values as consts then I could see this being difficult to implement, but I know nothing of compiler design so hopefully it can be done!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24209/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "nnpcYvIVl": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24207", "title": "#pragma warning disable not functioning in shared project file", "body": "**Version Used**: \r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 \r\nVersion 15.5.3\r\nVisualStudio.15.Release/15.5.3+27130.2020\r\nMicrosoft .NET Framework\r\nVersion 4.7.02556\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n#pragma warning disable does not function when it's in a file used by a shared project.

The evaluation of an anonymous function conversion depends on the target type of the conversion: If it is a delegate type, the conversion evaluates to a delegate value referencing the method which the anonymous function defines. If it is an expression tree type, the conversion evaluates to an expression tree which represents the structure of the method as an object structure.\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, if you think that a lambda is of type `Func` or `Action` I would really suggest you go read all of section 7.15 of the C# specification, since we're probably going to end up pretty far in the weeds here.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70340667/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70357220", "body": "@kasajian \n\n> Is that a bad idea for C#?\n\nLeaving aside any technical issues (which are substantial) IMHO, yes.\n\nI've long considered ML allowing H-M in top-level methods a mistake made more for theoretical purity than practical usefulness. Almost every ML ends up with style guidelines which prohibit using inference in top-level declarations, partially because of the quick realization after using strong typing that types are actually a form of documentation, but a better form. The question is, if everyone agrees that it's bad style, why allow it in the first place?\n\nConsider what happens when you write many top level declarations which are interdependent for inference:\n1. Type checking takes forever\n2. Top-level type contracts become extremely brittle. If a top level return type is inferred from a call to another method and the second method is changed by an unrelated change by an unrelated developer, instead of getting a type error your public contract magically changes return type.\n3. You start debugging type inference failures with foreign types from all over the compilation. If you've worked in a sizable Haskell project you know what I mean. If you haven't, it's like debugging C++ template errors (but slightly better).\n\nThere are only a few situations that I could see getting better. Fields with duplicate type names are kind of annoying and I would rather not type `List<int> field = new List<int>();`. Small, very understandable private helper methods could be easier to write. I'm not opposed to doing something  for these specific pain points, but I'd prefer to discuss tightly constrained examples if we want to think about it. To me, the larger proposal is a net negative, even if we could get it to work.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70357220/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70590631", "body": "@MadsTorgersen This still means we would need to infer the type of the local function based on later usage, correct?

To back up the claim that this is a problem with the C# compiler, let's do the same in VB.NET. Compile and run the following VB.NET program, which is equivalent to the above C# program. Note that there will be no runtime errors.\r\n\r\n   ```vb\r\n   Public Class SomeType\r\n       Public Sub Method(Optional timestamp As DateTime = Nothing)\r\n       End Sub\r\n   End Class\r\n\r\n   Module Program\r\n       Sub Main()\r\n           Dim parameter = GetType(SomeType).GetMethod(\"Method\").GetParameters()(0)\r\n           System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert(parameter.DefaultValue = DirectCast(Nothing, DateTime))\r\n           ' This should work just fine.\r\n       End Sub\r\n   End Module\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nI'm providing a solution containing xUnit.NET tests demonstrating the same problem in some more detail: \r\n[DateTimeBug.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/files/1598858/DateTimeBug.zip)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior:\r\n\r\nBoth the C# program and the equivalent VB.NET program should terminate without producing any error.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if C# does not actually support this scenario, i. e. `default(DateTime)` as a compile-time constant, it should produce a compile-time error.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior:\r\n\r\nBoth programs compile without any errors or warnigns, but the C# program throws a `System.FormatException` with message _\"Encountered an invalid type for a default value\"_.\r\n\r\n### Apparent cause:\r\n\r\nThe C# compiler does not emit a `[DateTimeConstant]` custom attribute placed on the optional method parameter like the VB.NET compiler does. Instead, it sets the default value to the `nullref` constant (like it would for any other value type). The framework (`ParameterInfo.DefaultValue`) probably doesn't expect this for `DateTime` (it expects to find the default value in a custom attribute; when `MdConstant.GetValue` retrieves a null reference from metadata for `DateTime`, it'll throw, see [here]( https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/reflection/parameterinfo.cs,617) and [here]( https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/reflection/mdconstant.cs,81) in the .NET Framework reference source).\r\n\r\nHere's the IL metadata output (as reported by ILDASM) for the above two programs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// IL output produced by the C# compiler:\r\n.method public hidebysig instance void  Method([opt] valuetype [mscorlib]System.DateTime timestamp) cil managed\r\n{\r\n  .param [1] = nullref\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// IL output produced by the VB.NET compiler:\r\n.method public instance bool  Method([opt] valuetype [mscorlib]System.DateTime timestamp) cil managed\r\n{\r\n  .param [1]\r\n  .custom instance void [mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.DateTimeConstantAttribute::.ctor(int64) = ( 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ) \r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24004/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "PhilPJL": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24000", "title": "Microsoft.Net.Compilers langversion not passed to csc.exe by MSBuild", "body": "VS 2017 15.5.2\r\nVSTS current version\r\n\r\n1.

It's not uncommon at all to see the following:\n\n``` csharp\nWriteLine(params object[] args)\nWriteLine(object arg)\nWriteLine(object arg1, object arg2)\n\n...\n\n// The above pattern lets the following bind without the object[] allocation\nWriteLine(\"dog\");\n```\n\nSwitching to `IEnumerable<T>` would not help here and would in fact make it works because it creates two allocations for a small number of arguments:\n- The collection allocation at the call site\n- The `IEnumerator<T> allocation in the caller \n\nAn idea we've sketched around a few times is a struct of the following nature:\n\n```\nstruct Arguments<T> : IEnumerable<T>\n{\n  T _arg1; \n  T _arg2;\n  IEnumerable<T> _enumerable;\n  int _count;\n\n  // struct based enumerator \n  // index which intelligently switches between T fields and enumerable\n}\n\nWriteLine(params Arguments<T> args)\n```\n\nThe `Arguments<T>` struct represents a collection of arguments.

It's not about specific optimizations within the method.  The allocation may seem small, and typically is in isolated scenarios.  Added up over an entire application though the array allocations add up (and quite fast).  \n\nI've worked on several projects where we've measured significant performance improvements by adding a few overloads to `params` methods that avoid call site allocations.  The implementation of the non-params overload had no special optimizations.  The algorithms, minus the loop, were identical to the `params` overload.  \n\nThis is why I don't see the value in adding `params IEnumerable<T>`.  It is solving only one of the current issues with `params` (not being inclusive to all collection types).  I'd much rather invest in a solution that solves all of them.  A solution like `Arguments<T>` has the possibility of doing so because:\n- It avoids the call site allocation in the target cases.\n- It can accept `IEnumerable<T>` as input (which in turn includes `T[]`).\n- The compiler can easily hide the implementation details in the same way it does for `params T[]` methods today. \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70532578/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70536647", "body": ">  You're better off keeping the specialized overloads since bouncing through a struct intermediary will be slower, even if you reference the fields containing the values directly\n\nCompletely disagree.

Most performance investigations end up doing little more than trying to reduce the GC time which translates into curbing unnecessary allocations. \n\nAny time we create a feature in the language that has unnecessary allocations, it's a feature that will likely be avoided by perf sensitive applications.

This created the abstraction of how we pushed updates to the workspace, and came with the rule that the VisualStudioProjectTracker was unable to ever touch a workspace directly.\r\n\r\nToday, that's not how we build our out-of-proc components. We now have an in-proc workspace, and we mirror that in-proc workspace via a pull model to the out-of-process workspace. This meant that the\r\ninterface was nearly pointless, except it was being used for the out-of-proc workspace setup to mirror some persistence settings over. Providing a new interface to do that directly is simpler and also\r\nmuch cheaper, as it doesn't come with the overhead of pushing workspace changes to the remote host that were being ignored.\r\n\r\nThis has the direct perf benefit of removing some delays around setting up the remote workspace since we're not computing useless data. It has longer-term benefits to aid in further refactorings, as we now have workspace updates going directly to the in-proc workspace, which we can start to do in a free-threaded manner.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Ask Mode template not completed</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- This template is not always required.

This is still a very fancy no-op in that the .editorconfig parsing isn't implemented (that's the next step), but this should allow conversation at the overarching shape. The pattern that ended up here was:\r\n\r\n- CompilationOptions consumes a new provider a la the other providers that are already there. This is an abstraction of \"get me options for a syntax tree\", with no policy statements made (other than expectations of immutability.)\r\n- An implementation of that provider that will consume/parse .editorconfig files. NB: the IDE will eventually have an alternative implementation that does the .editorconfig parsing but backstops on VS IDE options if there is no .editorconfig.\r\n- The API Compilation.GetOptionsForSyntaxTree() which fetches the option set.\r\n\r\nThe earlier thought we were going with was the API was constrained to the AnalyzerOptions type, so this is a change. The main challenge was although not in the plan for 15.3, the eventual hope is the compiler is also consuming .editorconfig for impacting the effective diagnostic severity of compiler warnings; in the case where you want to control warnings but otherwise have no other options, you don't (today) have an AnalyzerOptions at all, and the compiler doesn't otherwise have any visibility (as far as I can tell) to the AnalyzerOptions type: that's constrained to the analyzer driver.\r\n\r\nThere was a smaller benefit that if you're doing code generation and have a Compilation object you might want to get options for a tree without being in an analyzer as well. In those scenarios you're probably in a workspace though and could still stay at the workspace layer to get options, but once again the distinction felt a bit strange.\r\n\r\nIf we did want to keep this back on AnalyzerOptions we could do that, but then need a plan for how the compiler would consume this from an AnalyzerOptions even if there isn't an analyzer active. If we had a solution, then I think the API changes would be to move:\r\n\r\n1. CompilationOptions.SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider to AnalyzerOptions.SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider\r\n2. Compilation.GetOptionsForSyntaxTree() to AnalyzerOptions.GetOptionsForSyntaxTree()\r\n\r\nand with the obvious follow ups.\r\n\r\nStill to do before this particular PR merges:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make matching API updates in VB (there's a TODO or two)\r\n- [x] Update the API shape for also getting options for additional files, which I'm realizing probably means I have to rename SyntaxTreeOptionsProvider to something a bit more vague.

Something like:\n\nWhen multiple fixes need to be applied to documents, there are various way to do it:\n- **Sequential approach**: One way to do it is to compute diagnostics, pick one, ask a fixer to produce a codeaction to fix that, apply it. Now for the resulting new compilation, recomputed diagnostics, pick the next one and repeat the process. This approach would be very slow but would lead to correct results (unless it doesn't converge where one fix introduces a diagnostic that was just fixed by a previous fix). We chose to not implement this approach.\n- **Batch fix approach** - Another way to do this to compute all the diagnostics, pick each diagnostic and give it to a fixer to and ask it apply it to produce a new solution. If there were 'n' diagnostics, there would be 'n' new solutions. Now just merge them all together in one go. This may produce incorrect results (when different fixes change the same region of code in different ways) but it is very fast. We have one implementation of this approach in `WellKnownFixAllProviders.BatchFixer`\n- **Custom approach** - Depending on the fix, there may be a custom solution to fix multiple issues. For example, consider an analyzer that simply needs to generate one file as the fix for any instance of the issue. Instead of generating the same file over and over using the previous two approaches, one could write a custom `FixAllProvider` that simply generates the file once if there were any diagnostics at all.\n\nSince there are various ways of fixing all issues, we've implemented a framework and provided the one general implementation that we think is useful in many cases.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/pulls/comments/32879077/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/pulls/comments/36006360", "body": "Ya because ImmutableArray is a value type and can't ever be null\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/pulls/comments/36006360/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/pulls/comments/36536836", "body": "You can simply check if namedTypeSymbol.SpecialType == SpecialType.System_String and don't need to store the symbol anywhere.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/pulls/comments/36536836/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/pulls/comments/36537392", "body": "With this you are suppressing this check for all value types - so all structs as well.

Since it was a fairly simple change, I decided to go ahead and implement so that the PR could be used for discussion (and hopefully merged eventually).\r\n\r\n**Customer scenario**\r\n\r\n.NET documentation generators have been forced to come up with their own ways of representing namespace documentation, and nearly all of them have tried to approach namespace-level documentation in one way or another. This shows that the lack of official compiler support for namespace documentation comments is an ongoing deficit. This PR adds support for reporting XML documentation comments at the namespace level in both Roslyn symbol representations and the generated XML documentation output file.\r\n\r\n**Bugs this fixes:** \r\n\r\n#15474\r\n\r\n**Workarounds, if any**\r\n\r\nReflection can be used to get the formatted XML documentation for a namespace (see #15474).\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\n\r\nThere is a chance that changes to the generated XML documentation output file to include namespace XML documentation comments might break consumers of the file. This is mitigated by the fact that unless a namespace has XML documentation comments in the first place, they won't be output to the file. The presence of such comments on a namespace prior to this change is unlikely as they wouldn't have been picked up by the compiler and so would have been of little use.\r\n\r\n**Performance impact**\r\n\r\nI suspect (though do not know for sure) that this has a low performance impact since it uses the same mechanisms of compiling documentation comments as do other symbols, which have already been optimized.\r\n\r\n**Is this a regression from a previous update?**\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**Root cause analysis:**\r\n\r\nThis is new functionality, and a test has been added to verify correct operation.\r\n\r\n**How was the bug found?**\r\n\r\nWhile developing a Roslyn-based .NET documentation generator and requiring information about namespaces to be available.\r\n", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "ctaggart": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/pulls/15206", "title": "include portable pdb in nupkg", "body": "Revisiting @davkean's [plan from February](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/3#issuecomment-180123687), this is the start of Step 1.

For \"real\" methods, however, I would not support adding that feature (or else you probably should also add `var` for fields and (potentially?) properties). But then again, I'm also not a fan of C++'s auto return types.\n\nOptimization is certainly an interesting topic when considering local function declarations, as there are many opportunities. Let's go through a couple of cases:\n\n``` C#\nint F()\n{\n   int f(int x) => x;\n   return f(3);\n}\n```\n\nIn that case, the compiler could simply emit a static function into the class which is then called directly. No delegate construction is required. As efficient as it gets.\n\n``` C#\nstatic int y;\nint F()\n{\n   int f(int x) => x + y;\n   return f(3);\n}\n```\n\nSame as above, as the local function only accesses its own parameters and static variables of the enclosing class. The closure does not require a display class in that case.\n\n``` C#\nint y;\nint F()\n{\n   int f(int x) => x + y;\n   return f(3);\n}\n```\n\nWe can simply create an _instance_ method in that case to capture the closure semantics of the instance variable. Again, no delegate needs to be constructed.\n\n``` C#\nint F(int y)\n{\n   int f(int x) => x + y;\n   return f(3);\n}\n```\n\nThis is an interesting case. We either have to instantiate a display class that captures the method parameter. Or we change the signature of f such that y is also passed as an parameter (but that is most likely not always possible, I'd guess). In any case, no delegate construction is required. The invocation of f simply invokes the generated method on the display class.\n\nGenerally, for small functions like the one above, it might even be beneficial to completely inline them. So the compiler should probably emit them with the `aggressiveinlining` flag, allowing the JIT compiler to do its inlining magic.\n\nWhen a local function is passed to another function, a delegate must of course be created. In that case, I suggest to use the same rules for caching as for lambdas (i.e., only cache functions without a closure, if I recall correctly).\n\nTwo other things to consider: Do we want to expose local functions in the metadata explicitly? That is, should the reflection APIs be extended such that `MethodInfo` has a property `IEnumerable<MethodInfo> LocalMethods { get; }`?\n\nLocal function declarations probably should support attributes, so that I'm able to write, for instance:\n\n``` C#\nint F(int y)\n{\n   [DebuggerHidden]\n   int f(int x) => x + y;\n   return f(3);\n}\n```\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70464101/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70464259", "body": "@paulomorgado: Conceptual clarity.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70464259/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70464259", "body": "@paulomorgado: Conceptual clarity.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70464259/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70496406", "body": "@paulomorgado (also @mikedn): Your first example defines a local function `m` which you subsequently call.

In this case, the method is compatible with any delegate that matches the signature.

If you access every element of each chunk asynchronously (with await) you are incurring a lot of overhead, and essentially blurring the \"degree of asynchrony\" of the source.\n\nA third issue is query operators. You could certainly imagine implementing the Linq pattern over an asynchronous stream type, but the way query expressions work today, they generate synchronous lambdas, so logic applied in the query clauses themselves couldn't use await. This would be severely limiting. Maybe we can find a way to extend query expressions to deal with this.\n\nLanguage support for asynchronous sequences would at least support iterators, and possibly also foreach loops and asynchronous query expressions.\n\nSo: this is something I'd love for us to look at for the next version of C#.

I assume you are still working on this as part of the move to GitHub but I thought it might be helpful to report the issues I'm seeing right now.\n\nI created a clean VS2015 CTP5 machine on Azure today, installed the CTP SDK, cloned Roslyn (at the time master's HEAD was 7fed8e8https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/7fed8e8e946c080aa6daf5933effdf1b9e40d15c) and ran msbuild /m BuildAndTest.proj /p:DeployExtension=false.\n\nHere are the problems I saw:\n\nBuild Failure\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v14.0\\VSSDK\\Microsoft.VsSDK.targets(760,5):     error : CreatePkgDef : error : FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'OpenSourceDebug,    Version=42.42.42.42, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its    dependencies. Strong name validation failed. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8013141A)   [c:\\dev\\roslyn\\Src\\Tools\\Source\\OpenSourceDebug\\OpenSourceDebug.csproj]\n\nI ran sn -Vr *,31bf3856ad364e35 to work around this.\n\nCrashes during test run\n\nWhen the tests run, for every test tries to launch the command line compiler (and there are many), a crash dialog pops up saying that \"VBCSCompiler has stopped working\" or \"csc.exe has stopped working\". I also got an error saying:\n\nUnhandled Exception: System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'csc,Version=42.42.42.42, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. Strong name validation failed. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8013141A) ---\n\nAgain, this seems to be related to strong name validations, and this time the fact I SN -Vr'ed that same public key didn't help. To get past the crash dialogs, I manually deleted Roslyn.Compilers.CompilerServer.UnitTests.dll Roslyn.Compilers.CSharp.CommandLine.UnitTests.dll and Roslyn.Compilers.VisualBasic.CommandLine.UnitTests.dll, and then ran:\nmsbuild /target:test /m BuildAndTest.proj /p:DeployExtension=false\n\nRemaining unit test failures\n\nFinally, the resulting UnitTestResults.html filehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_DL7JsBKCwiVkpjVFlTQ180ZDg/view?usp=sharing reported 2 unit test failures, while the command-line window consistently reported 39.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/22.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70373518/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70378888", "body": "I expect it will be fine.\n\nAnd thanks for your contributions.\n\nKevin\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70378888/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "am11": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70375867", "body": "@MadsTorgersen, \n\nBackward compatibility will certainly make things complicated here.\n\nIt is a syntactic sugar to state the intent, in pursuit of keeping the code compact and bring about DRY.\n\nThis decorator may replace the nicknames with the original counterparts at compile time and keep the IL isolated (from capturing this incident).\n\nThe idea really is to explicitly _tag_ the multifaceted parameter, without specifying the code comment at caller to describe its purpose.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70375867/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70779580", "body": "Why not simply [embed the docx](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/embed-files-website-blog) via onedrive in GitHub [repo's wiki](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki)? \n\nSomething like:\n\n``` html\n<iframe\n  src=\"https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=...\"\n  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\"\n  scrolling=\"yes\"\n></iframe>\n```\n\nI have seen this practice used on http://isocpp.org/ (for excel files) and some WordPress blogs.\n\nupload > right-click > embed > generate ..\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70779580/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "OmerRaviv": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70377166", "body": "Thank you for the clarification!

I agree that `_` may be a poor choice because it breaks backwards-compatibility and I like `*` just as much.\nPattern-matching might be an interesting feature, but I think this here might be something independent. It's nonetheless a good idea though to keep the wildcard-symbol consistent.\nI like the idea of having a way to also skip all following arguments, although I am not sure this increases readability in the end. An explicit symbol might be useful, so a reader knows there is some magic happening:\n\n``` csharp\nvoid Foo(Func<string> func) { ... }\nvoid Foo(Func<int, int, string> func) { ... }\nvoid Foo(Func<int, int, bool, DateTime, string> func) { ... }\n\nFoo(() => \"0\"); //->Calls first function\nFoo(* => \"0\"); //->Compiler error, no function with 1 argument available\nFoo((*) => \"0\"); //->Compiler error, no function with 1 argument available\n\nFoo(** => \"0\"); //->Calls second function\nFoo((**) => \"0\"); //->Calls second function\nFoo((i, *) => i.ToString()); //->Calls second function\nFoo((*, n) => n.ToString()); //->Calls second function\nFoo((i, **) => i.ToString()); //->Calls second function\n\nFoo((i, *, *) => i.ToString()); //->Compiler error, no function with 3 arguments available\nFoo((i, *, **) => i.ToString()); //->Calls third function\nFoo((i, *, *, *) => i.ToString()); //->Calls third function\nFoo((i, *, *, **) => i.ToString()); //->Calls third function\n\nFoo((i, *, *, *, *) => i.ToString()); //->Compiler error, no function with 5 arguments available\nFoo((i, *, *, *, **) => i.ToString()); //->Compiler error, no function with 5+ arguments available\n```\n\nThe `**` can therefore be used to skip all following (at least 1) parameters, choosing the function with the fewest arguments available. `**` can only be used as the last argument of the lambda.\n\nI actually have no problem with typing the wildcards. Of course the `**` can not be typed, but single-wildcards should not be a problem.

And I'm not even assuming that most of the local functions/anonymous methods are used to close over locals and to pass along as a delegate.\n\nI think a lot of assumptions are being made about the implementation. I'm assuming that the difference between a local function and an anonymous method is the lack of the need for a delegate. I assume it will implemented just the same way.\n\nMaybe it was a bad decision the name the generated methods based on the type name instead of the function name.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70513145/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70571802", "body": "Oops!

If there is an initializer, the restrictions on it are the same as for regular initializers, and it is run at the same time as other instance/static initializers.\n\nIf there isn't an initializer for non-readonly fields, it's up to the method to do any necessary initialization and locking etc. if thread safety is required. Alternatively, constructors could be allowed to set the field via MethodName.fieldname = blah; , much like they can for get-only auto-props now, although this falls apart when more than one overload uses an identically named method-local field :/\n\nIf the developer wants lazy semantics for the field - it's just the same as with a \"normal\" field, declare it as type Lazy<T>, and refer to field.Value in the method.\n\nMulti-threaded scenarios are also explicitly not handled, as is the case with normal fields.\n\nI think all this fulfils the principle of least astonishment better as the syntactic sugar is incredibly thin, and it means that we get better scoping without having to worry about some complicated codegen going on underneath (which could change assumptions about things like memory use/locality etc.)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70900054/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/roslyn/issues/comments/70907015", "body": "Don't we then reintroduce the problem of making it harder for the developer to know easily at a glance when the field is going to be initialized?

So we can't cast it back in order to get its result. We have to implement it ourselves here.\n\n@jasonmalinowski I think your proposal would work fine if `task` completed successfully or if `cancellationToken` is canceled. But if `task` transitioned to either a canceled or faulted state, the result would not be what the caller expects. If `task` faults, `t.Result` will throw AggregateException, then the task returned from `ContinueWith` will wrap that in _another_ AggregateException. So you end up wrapping the exception in extra layers that a catch block later may not be expecting.

Basically the same thing as an exported type when it's tagged as a NonShared part.\r\n\r\nMy first guess about the deadlock is that different importers are getting unique instances of JTC even within the same test and MEF graph, which means they can't interact to resolve deadlocks. If you're all on the same (main) thread, this probably wouldn't actually be an issue. But if you actually have multiple threads going for an individual test, and you care about the simulated 'main' thread, then you need to ensure that you have one JTC instance shared for the whole test and you need a way for a non-main thread in the test to schedule work for the 'main' thread. This would require that you set up a SynchronizationContext on the 'main' thread that can schedule work, and then see that that thread actually pumps those messages. It's not hard, but it must be done within your test project.\r\n\r\n> Roslyn tests reuse ExportProvider\r\n\r\nThat's unfortunate. ExportProvider itself is actually really cheap. It's composing the graph that's expensive. I wonder if they've tried just constructing the catalog and graph once, and sharing the resulting ExportProviderFactory for all tests, but each individual test gets its own ExportProvider? That sounds like it would be the best combination of perf and test isolation.\r\nBut if you *must* share the ExportProvider, then we're basically saying that all tests need to share a JTC and thus share a 'main' thread.
