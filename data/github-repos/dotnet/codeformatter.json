The user of codeformatter won't notice that the rules are now implemented as analyzers/fixers; that\u2019s an implementation detail. Codeformatter will simply calls the Roslyn APIs to run the analyzers/fixers.\n\nThe advantage is that VS users will be able to use the analyzers/fixers as well. In other words, the effort here is to make the rules/fixes use the Roslyn extensibility model and make codeformatter a simple command line driver for it.\n\nSri prototyped the technique in his version of [FormattingEngineImplementation.cs](https://github.com/srivatsn/codeformatter/blob/master/src/Microsoft.DotNet.CodeFormatting/FormattingEngineImplementation.cs) in his [fork](https://github.com/srivatsn/codeformatter) of codeformatter. The important part is his reimplementation of the method `FormatProjectAsync`. It runs the analyzers by creating a `CompilationWithAnalyzers` and calling `GetDiagnostics` on it. Then it runs the fixers, and applies the fixes to the workspace.\n\nIn the prototype, Sri completely removed the existing \u201crule-based\u201d implementation (\"driver\") in `FormatProjectAsync`. But in the actual implementation, the two drivers will exist side by side. `FormatProjectAsync` will continue  to call the rule-based driver unless the command line option `/UseAnalyzers` is present, in which case it will call the new analyzer-based implementation. This will allow us to do perf comparisons as we reimplement each rule, for example:\n\n```\ncodeformatter MyProject.csproj /Rule:ThisRule,ThatRule\ncodeformatter MyProject.csproj /UseAnalyzers /Rule:ThisRule,ThatRule\n```\n\nWhen all the rules have been reimplemented as analyzers, we will remove the rules, and remove the rule-based driver from the engine.\n\nThe analyzer-based implementation will have to take care to run the analyzers in such a way that fixes from different analyzers don\u2019t overlap and interfere with one another. We will add an `Attribute` to the analyzers that can all run together in a single compilation; the others will each run in a separate compilation.\n\nWe will place the analyzers/fixers in their own project, separate from the engine, so we can ship them in a NuGet package without having to ship the engine.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/codeformatter/issues/137/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/codeformatter/issues/133", "title": "DOTNET_FORMATTER symbol is unconditionally applied", "body": "In `FormatDocumentFormattingRule.ProcessAsync`, in the loop over additional configurations, the `DOTNET_FORMATTER` symbol is added to the parse options regardless of the presence of the `/tables` option on the command line.\n\n@Srivatsn, @jaredpar \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/codeformatter/issues/133/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commits": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/codeformatter/commits/8fb449c091b191f27148a89565c952ed9fd816e7", "message": "build.cmd should always check for NuGet package updates\n\nbuild.cmd was skipping the NuGet restore command if the\nsrc\\packages directory existed at all, regardless of what\nwas in it.

I think global rules are going to be the exception, not the rule.  Formatting changes are much more likely to be local.  \n\nNote: the rules don't have the same signature.  One returns a `Solution` the other returns a `SyntaxNode`.  This is an intentional difference meant to help push developers to choose the right rule.  If you do an operation that produces a new `Solution` there is no way to implement `ILocalSemanticFormattingRule` correctly.  You would be forced into `IGlobalSemanticFormattingRule`.\n\n> Do you have a feel for how much worse the performance would be if we were to get rid of local semantic rules?\n\nIt's pretty dramatic.  The difference between hours and minutes to run on moderate / large projects. \n\nThe key performance win is in the running of `ILocalSemanticFormattingRule`.

If the two rules were merged this would go away and we'd need to recreate a `SemanticModel` for every change the rule made.

Essentially at the very last step instead of calling `TryApplyChanges` we enter into a diffing mode where we simply compare the textual content of every `Document` object in the set of `DocumentId` being considered for changes.\n\nImplementing validation mode with good error messages though is trickier.  There are certain rules for which generating a good error message is easy: private field rename, explicit this, etc ...  Rules where we both identify and correct the problem.  \n\nBut rules like just formatting the code aren't even really doable.  We don't control the code in question there and simply rely on the operation being idempotent.  It's not really possible to detect the error up front.  \n\nIn some ways though maybe this is okay.  The tool is designed to make formatting easy, not bug developers about individual rule.  Perhaps a message that `Document.cs isn't formatted` correctly is enough.  Giving detail about the error would imply that we wanted them to fix it vs. say \"just run the formatter\".  \n\nFor context though we haven't really found a need for validation mode yet.  The way I've been handing Roslyn is I just run the formatter once a week, validate the tests are passing and push the change.  The only reason I even send the change out for review is because the IDE team is interested in inspecting the output to see if they've inadvertently introduced any errors into the code.  \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/codeformatter/issues/comments/77398208/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/codeformatter/issues/comments/77600797", "body": ":+1: \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/codeformatter/issues/comments/77600797/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/codeformatter/issues/comments/77890335", "body": "@dannyvv where are you seeing MSBuildWorkspace emit with a BOM?

We've started work on porting some of the shared rules to VB. Expect to hear more from us on VB style in the coming days.\n\nRE: Kraeven said:\n\n> _...we have a lot of projects in VB (unfortunat[e]ly)_\n\nOur open source community is young yet and I think this raises a good opportunity to talk about how we all engage each other here.\n\nFirst and foremost, the .NET Foundation is and needs to remain a place where **all** .NET developers feel welcome to participate. That means C# developers, F# developers, and VB developers too. Of course we all have preferences, but, we absolutely do not want to create a culture here where developers feel a need when jumping into conversation to apologize for what languages or technologies they're using or not using, or to make disparaging remarks about Java, or JavaScript, or VB, or C++, or VB6, or anything else to establish any kind of \"street cred\". You shouldn't feel that when you come here and you have VB.NET code you need to drop a casual insult on the product so that other developers will respect you. There should be an expectation here that you and your inquiries and opinions, provided they are on topic and given in a civil manner are respected and responded to in kind as a matter of course. Remarks like this are at worst inflammatory and at best distracting and send the message to people who use VB (like myself) that the .NET Foundation open source community is hostile and not a place for them and it sends the message to people who don't use VB that they can get cool points here by dumping on it. Neither of those are the right messages to send.\n\nSecondly, it is important to keep in mind that this is a community where developers can engage members of the Microsoft product teams who work directly on a number of products, including VB and you never know when someone who is or has worked on a product, such as VB, may be listening or may even be the very person you're soliciting help from or making a suggestion to. For example, both Jared and I are members of the Visual Basic Language Design team. I've been a huge VB fan and advocate personally and professionally for years (even before joining Microsoft), have worked on the VB compiler as part of the \"Roslyn\" project for five years, and coincidentally own figuring out whether and how to extend the VB styling guidelines already provided by the formatter/pretty-lister. Jared has owned or worked in parts of the VB compiler, IDE, and debugger for many more years than that. We and dozens of others have worked very hard and very passionately on VB for years and we take an incredible amount of pride in that work and VB and its community just as much as we do in C# and F# and those communities. And by \"take pride in\" I mean we're _fans_ who have VB T-shirts, and VB coffee mugs, and VB banners in the hallways who use VB daily and delight in the opportunity to do so (and to be clear, _most_ of us, particularly on the Managed Languages team work on _and in_ more than one language). When you flippantly insult a product that dozens of people have poured a lot of love into in a forum that's kept vibrant in part by the dialog between consumers and those product owners you run the risk of creating either disengaged or defensive product group team members, neither of which contributes positively to the health of the .NET open source community.\n\nIn summary, let's keep this place fun, positive, and welcoming for everyone invested in .NET and its future and leave the language bashing and all the other stuff outside, ok?\n\nWarmest regards,\n\n**Anthony D.

If retval appears to be false, put in this logic to sanity check you don't need to flip the result to true due to the missing node case you've identified.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/codeformatter/pulls/comments/36569624/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/codeformatter/pulls/comments/37812603", "body": "This change drops the requirement to prefix a SLN or project file target with -t or --target.
