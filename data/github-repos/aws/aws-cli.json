Pass a serialised, sh-escaped (which makes non-sh/bash aliases difficult to write) `parsed_globals` via a new environment variable (eg `AWS_CLI_ALIAS_PARSED_GLOBALS`) which can then be eval'ed by the child-process. This data could also be in Base64-encoded JSON (though this is now getting complicated). We could also have _multiple_ new variables (eg `AWS_CLI_PROFILE`) -- which starts to make it similar to solution 3c. Expected output then becomes:\r\n     ```console\r\n     $ aws --profile foo test subcommand --bar abc\r\n     ENV:\r\n     - AWS_CLI_ALIAS_PARSED_GLOBALS='profile=foo color=auto paginate=1 command=test connect_timeout=60 sign_request=1 read_timeout=60 debug='\r\n     ARGS: subcommand --bar abc\r\n     ```\r\n  b. Add it to the command-line. Unfortunately, we really need the unparsed-args. Else, we need to revert `endpoint_url` to `--endpoint-url` and I don't fancy dealing with duplicated logic. We could also modify `ExternalAliasCommand.__call__` (and `ServiceAliasCommand` etc) to transmit the unparsed args (also see: https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/develop/awscli/clidriver.py#L208 ). Expected output then becomes:\r\n     ```console\r\n     $ aws --profile foo test subcommand --bar abc\r\n     ENV:\r\n\r\n     ARGS: --profile foo subcommand --bar abc\r\n     ```\r\n  c. For some parameters (eg `--profile`), modify the existing standardised environment variable (ie `AWS_PROFILE`) instead. However, there are no standardised variable names for most of the existing parameters. Expected output then becomes:\r\n     ```console\r\n     $ aws --profile foo test subcommand --bar abc\r\n     ENV:\r\n     - AWS_PROFILE=foo\r\n     ARGS: subcommand --bar abc\r\n     ```\r\n     Note that existing environment parameters exists for the following options only:\r\n     * `--profile` to `AWS_PROFILE`\r\n     * `--region` to `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`\r\n     * `--output` to `AWS_DEFAULT_OUTPUT`\r\n     * `--ca-bundle` to `AWS_CA_BUNDLE`\r\n\r\n     And none for (if this is the desired solution, I'd also like to hear opinions on appropriate environment variable names for the following, my recommendations in brackets):\r\n     * `--color` (`AWS_COLOR`)\r\n     * `--no-paginate` (`AWS_NO_PAGINATE`)\r\n     * `--cli-connect-timeout` (`AWS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`)\r\n     * `--no-sign-request` (`AWS_NO_SIGN_REQUEST`)\r\n     * `--no-verify-ssl` (`AWS_NO_VERIFY_SSL`)\r\n     * `--cli-read-timeout` (`AWS_READ_TIMEOUT`)\r\n     * `--debug` (`AWS_DEBUG`)\r\n     * `--endpoint-url` (`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`)\r\n\r\n     A reason for the negatives is that by common (though not universal) Unix/Linux convention, a missing variable is treated identically to an empty string which is then interpreted as a boolean false. And given the existing default values for those variables, a `AWS_NO_` name seems more appropriate.\r\n* As an aside, `git` solves a similar problem by selecting solution c. There are also issues which would benefit from a consistent and complete set of environment variables (eg in https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/2007 the user could switch on `--debug` for all their aws-cli invocations simply by toggling `AWS_DEBUG`).\r\n* Before I start coding up a solution, I'd like to hear from aws-cli maintainers what's likely to be merged. I want to avoid spending a lot of time coding/debugging, only for the patch to be rejected due to a difference of opinion at the very first step.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/3102/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "Dunedan": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/3101", "title": "Subcommand help broken", "body": "In 1.14.29 the subcommand help is broken, so commands such as e.g. `aws ec2 describe-images help` don't work anymore.

It can be enabled, e.g. by adding these lines in `~/.inputrc`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Tab & shift-tab to run through all options instead of showing a list\r\nTAB: menu-complete\r\n\"\\e[Z\": \"\\e-1\\C-i\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `aws_completer` command currently (`aws-cli/1.11.185 Python/2.7.12 Linux/4.4.0-98-generic botocore/1.7.43`) has two issues that prevent this working correctly.\r\n\r\n**Issue 1**\r\n\r\nThe first issue is if you enter a valid command (e.g. `s3`) and press tab, it overwrites the command that was entered with its own subcommands. For example (assume `|` represents the cursor):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ aws s3|\r\n# Press Tab\r\n$ aws cp  |\r\n# Press Tab again\r\n$ aws ls  |\r\n# etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas if the command name is incomplete when you press tab it works correctly:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ aws s|\r\n# Press Tab\r\n$ aws s3  |\r\n# Press Tab again\r\n$ aws s3api  |\r\n# etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because if the last word is a valid command, `aws_completer` returns the subcommands, whereas Bash expects you to return the matching commands *unless* there's a space at the end.\r\n\r\nHere's what it currently looks like if you run the `aws_completer` command directly:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Incomplete command (correct)\r\n$ COMP_LINE='aws s' aws_completer\r\nsdb\r\nservicecatalog\r\nses\r\nshield\r\nsms\r\nsnowball\r\nsns\r\nsqs\r\nssm\r\nstepfunctions\r\nstoragegateway\r\nsts\r\nsupport\r\nswf\r\ns3api\r\ns3\r\n\r\n# Valid command with no space at the end (wrong)\r\n$ COMP_LINE='aws s3' aws_completer\r\nwebsite\r\nmb\r\nsync\r\nmv\r\nls\r\nrb\r\nrm\r\ncp\r\npresign\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas it should output this to work consistently with other tab completions (Bash, Git, etc.):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Valid command with no space at the end\r\n$ COMP_LINE='aws s3' aws_completer\r\ns3api\r\ns3\r\n\r\n# Command with a space at the end\r\n$ COMP_LINE='aws s3 ' aws_completer\r\nwebsite\r\nmb\r\nsync\r\nmv\r\nls\r\nrb\r\nrm\r\ncp\r\npresign\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would result in the following:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ aws s3|\r\n# Press Tab\r\n$ aws s3 |\r\n# Press Tab again\r\n$ aws s3api |\r\n# etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ aws s3 |\r\n# Press Tab\r\n$ aws s3 cp |\r\n# Press Tab again\r\n$ aws s3 ls |\r\n# etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich would be consistent with how other commands are completed.\r\n\r\n**Issue 2**\r\n\r\nThe second issue is more of an annoyance than a problem, but it's also easier to fix: `aws_completer` outputs an extra space at the end of each line (except the last), which causes Bash to output two spaces instead of one. For example (again `|` represents the cursor):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ aws b|\r\n# Press Tab\r\n$ aws batch  |\r\n#          ^^ Two spaces\r\n# Press Tab again\r\n$ aws budgets |\r\n#            ^ One space because this is the last line\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be seen in the command output by adding an end of line marker:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ COMP_LINE='aws b' aws_completer | sed s/$/$/\r\nbatch $\r\nbudgets$\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the cause is [this line](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/e28e2fa0905dd37530404db4f0e67469fe39aaaa/awscli/completer.py#L134):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(' \\n'.join(choices))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich should be:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint('\\n'.join(choices))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can make a PR for this if you like.\r\n\r\nThanks!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2947/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/pulls/2955", "title": "Fix incorrect completions when using 'menu-complete' in Bash", "body": "Fixes both issues raised in #2947 ", "author_association": "NONE"}], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "orome": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2944", "title": "Still not using current colorama", "body": "Homebrew installs of `aws-cli` continue to downgrade `colorama` <= 0.3.7.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2944/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "konklone": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2942", "title": "AWS CLI has an unclosed socket upon exit", "body": "When running a command (it happened to be `aws lambda create-function`) using a version of Python 3.6 built in debug mode, I got this warning after it was done:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/path/to/lib/python3.6/site-packages/awscli/clidriver.py:508: ResourceWarning: unclosed <ssl.SSLSocket fd=3, family=AddressFamily.AF_INET, type=2049, proto=6, laddr=('XX.XX.XX.XX', 53512), raddr=('XX.XX.XX.XX', 443)>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's the end of this `__call__` function (which I verified are in the same state as the one on my machine):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/c032775b00248cd62b2366e2bea649c4943fed93/awscli/clidriver.py#L456-L508\r\n\r\nMay not be a big deal, as I expect Python cleans it up upon exit, but wanted to file it in case it's worthy of cleanup, especially for novel deployments of aws-cli which may not get cleaned up in this way.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2942/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "btisdall": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2940", "title": "`aws cloudformation deploy` \"strict\" parameters mode", "body": "I don't whether I'm alone in this, but IMO silent use of current stack state to provide missing parameter values during updates is an infrastructure as code anti-pattern.

The problem is, it doesn't in fact treat the input as a blob. It treats it as a string and tries to interpret it as utf8, so you can't actually pass a blob unless by coincidence you happen to be in possession of a blob that just happens to be comprised of entirely valid utf8 characters. Even if you pass JSON, it still encodes the Bytes value to base64.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, the only option is to upload the image to S3 first, and then refer to it by using the `S3Object` property.

You simply look under the metadata, zip as needed, upload, and save the result as a parameter default. Then leave it to the user to use it wherever it is needed.  As a technical detail you'd have to support mapping S3 attributes since various forms of the S3 bucket/path/url are needed across resource types. \r\n\r\nThis approach would make packaging possible anywhere an s3 artifact can be used, including places where the s3 URL needs to be interpolated.  It is inherently forward compatible with all resource types that may be added in the future. I imagine it wouldn't be too hard to make it backwards compatible with the existing package behavior.  \r\n\r\nLastly I think it establishes a pattern for the general problem of \"upload a local artifact\". Extending the pattern to non-s3 artifacts like docker containers would be a matter of adding new artifact types. \r\n\r\n### Variations\r\n\r\nOne obvious variation would be to simply print out the parameter values rather than rewriting the template. Personally I like that approach as it would make packaging a transparent extension to a template, much like the use of Metadata for cfn-init. It would also solve issues that arise in rewriting, like #2757. \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2862/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "chnaveens": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2860", "title": "Unable to create rds instance read replica with a tag that has space", "body": "aws rds create-db-instance-read-replica --db-instance-identifier \"some-name\" --region us-west-2 --source-db-instance-identifier \"arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:1234567778:db:some-name\" --source-region \"us-east-1\" --storage-type \"gp2\" --db-instance-class \"db.r3.large\" --tags \"Key\"=\"Stream\",\"Value\"=\"something with space\" --profile <profile>\r\n\r\ngetting following error ..\r\n\r\nAn error occurred (InvalidParameterValue) when calling the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation: PreSignedUrl could not be authenticated.\r\n\r\nPlease help me with a work around or a fix.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\naws --version\r\naws-cli/1.11.158 Python/2.7.10 Darwin/16.7.0 botocore/1.7.16", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2860/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "muhqu": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2849", "title": "Question: aws ec2 wait instance-status-ok and termination", "body": "Given I launch a new EC2 instance and want to wait for its status to become _ok_.

My understanding is that the suggested approach is to copy the files individually by invoking `aws s3 cp`, for example:\r\n\r\n    cat files.txt | parallel aws s3 cp s3://remote/path/{/} /local/path/{/}\r\n\r\nIn our experience, for files under about 1MB (we work with large image datasets), copy time is _CPU bound_ by the `aws` process.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, the following script which serves as an alternative to `aws s3 cp` takes about _1/10th_ the CPU usage by my measurements (and thus downloads files much faster):\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    contentType=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" \r\n    date=\"`date -u +'%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT'`\"\r\n    string=\"GET\\n\\n${contentType}\\n\\nx-amz-date:${date}\\n${1}\"\r\n    signature=`echo -en $string | openssl sha1 -hmac \"${AWS_SECRET_KEY}\" -binary | base64` \r\n    curl -o ${2} -s \\\r\n         -H \"x-amz-date: ${date}\" \\\r\n         -H \"Content-Type: ${contentType}\" \\\r\n         -H \"Authorization: AWS ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY}:${signature}\" \\\r\n         \"https://s3.amazonaws.com${1}\"\r\n\r\nWhere `${1}` is the S3 input path and `${2}` is the local output path.\r\n\r\nI profiled the `aws s3 cp` command and it seems that most of the time is spent by the Python interpreter initializing the execution environment. If there can't be anything done to speed this up, it would be helpful to have an aws command to copy a list of files in parallel to avoid re-occurring this compute cost.

This seems to be due to much better multithreading in Python 3 where all 8 cores are used and in Python 2 only 4 cores are used. In both cases I'm using a 16GB file with `multipart_chunksize = 512MB` and `max_concurrent_requests = 8`.\r\n\r\nWhy does the AWS CLI Installer uses Python 2.7?

The reference is parsed and replaced with the parameter's value (if the value is not dependent on a deploy time parameter) before the `package` command exports the resource's artifact to S3.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# package.yaml\r\nAWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09\r\nResources:\r\n  ApiStack:\r\n    Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack\r\n    Properties:\r\n      TemplateURL: ./api-template.yaml\r\n      Parameters:\r\n        SwaggerDoc: /path/to/swagger.yaml\r\n\r\n\r\n# api-template.yaml\r\nAWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09\r\nParameters:\r\n  SwaggerDoc:\r\n    Type: String\r\nResources:\r\n  MyFunction:\r\n    Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi\r\n    Properties:\r\n        BodyS3Location: !Ref SwaggerDoc\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe command maps the parameter `SwaggerDoc` in `api-template.yaml` to the parameter value passed in from `package.yaml` (`/path/to/swagger.yaml`) before iterating over the resources. When it comes to the `BodyS3Location` property of `MyFunction` it will replace the `!Ref SwaggerDoc` with the value `/path/to/swagger.yaml`, then export that file to S3.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis feature also converts any relative paths to absolute paths by merging with the calling template's ***parent*** directory's path.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n`./swagger.yaml` would become `/absolute/path/to/swagger.yaml`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis only affects the the specific properties of resources specified [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/package.html).

I did a little digging into resource usage using [`dstat`](http://dag.wiee.rs/home-made/dstat/) and [`pv`](http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml) and I'm observing that:\r\n\r\n1. `aws s3 cp` allocates 7-10x more mem than the multipart upload chunk size, whereas I'd expect it to allocate ~1x chunk size + a small constant overhead (<100MB)\r\n1. `aws s3 cp` fails to saturate net tx, alternating between two modes of resource usage:\r\n   1. steadily increasing mem usage, draining stdin ~25+ MB/s, and uploading to s3 only ~12 MB/s\r\n   1. peaks mem usage and stops draining stdin while s3 upload speed increases to only ~25 MB/s\r\n      - `gsutil cp foo s3://foo` achieves ~40-50 MB/s net tx from the same host\r\n   1. deallocates a bunch of mem and starts over at (i)\r\n\r\nHere are sample commands I'm using to observe these, along with the resource usage I observed for each:\r\n```sh\r\n# --expected-size 1 GB\r\n# chunk size ~100 KB (8 MB min?)\r\n# max mem usage ~115 MB\r\n# net tx ~12-25 MB/s\r\n(cat /dev/zero | pv -terbf | aws s3 cp --expected-size=$((1024*1024*1024 * 1)) - s3://foo) 2>&1 | tr '\\r' '\\n'\r\n\r\n# --expected-size 10 GB\r\n# chunk size

Make a virtualenv and install the latest aws-cli:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    virtualenv -ppython2.7 venv && venv/bin/pip install awscli\r\n    ```\r\n1. Make eight files files `f0` through `f7` which each consist of 1GB of a single byte repeated:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    for i in {0..7}; do\r\n        dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1000 | tr '\\000' \"\\00${i}\" > \"f${i}\"\r\n    done\r\n    ```\r\n2. Upload some of these files fully, with other uploads still in-progress, to the same key, then start a download of that key using aws-cli. Here's one example script:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    #!/usr/bin/time bash\r\n    set -euo pipefail\r\n    n=\"$RANDOM\"\r\n    key=\"s3://my-bucket/test-${n}\"\r\n    results=\"result-${n}\"\r\n\r\n    # stagger the uploads a bit, start them all in the background\r\n    for f in f*; do\r\n        venv/bin/aws s3 cp \"$f\" \"$key\" &\r\n        sleep 5\r\n    done\r\n\r\n    # wait for the first three to finish\r\n    wait %1\r\n    wait %2\r\n    wait %3\r\n\r\n    venv/bin/aws s3 cp \"$key\" \"$results\"\r\n    my_hash=$(openssl sha1 \"$results\" | cut -d' ' -f2)\r\n    echo \"my hash is: $my_hash\"\r\n    ```\r\n3. Compare the hash of the uploaded file with the `f` files, and it's usually different:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    $ openssl sha1 result-3854 f*\r\n    SHA1(result-3854)= 99db13b557cb00b7b15410bad1c360e89b530f58\r\n    SHA1(f0)= cb19f836c2830ff88ff45694565da65be73b7a69\r\n    SHA1(f1)= eee4fdda7e8ac4955b9d4b97fb823c07ba0f73b4\r\n    SHA1(f2)= c4f79272572f3fd74800c2d7b83c936646475c2e\r\n    SHA1(f3)= bc143c1ff8156c7ab8d41f4a700c1f2d16fbadb3\r\n    SHA1(f4)= f035d33802e80e293f9cdcc307474809a6c45ad1\r\n    SHA1(f5)= d406dcd45e1a85050ce0eaa34f708de4cf25b142\r\n    SHA1(f6)= 13f9c9358cd0824395f2890aacdced2e93b33f27\r\n    SHA1(f7)= 77bbea0dad5295f4e67c371825f0b1a857cc4b5b\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Looking at the hexdump, the downloaded file is a mix of f2, f3, f5, f6, and f7:\r\n    ```\r\n    $ hd result-3854\r\n    00000000  02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02  02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02  |................|\r\n    *\r\n    0e800000  03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03  03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03  |................|\r\n    *\r\n    16800000  05 05 05 05 05 05 05 05  05 05 05 05 05 05 05 05  |................|\r\n    *\r\n    1a800000  06 06 06 06 06 06 06 06  06 06 06 06 06 06 06 06  |................|\r\n    *\r\n    20800000  07 07 07 07 07 07 07 07  07 07 07 07 07 07 07 07  |................|\r\n    *\r\n    3e800000\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nI did these steps on Debian stretch.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if `aws-cli` could either download the file consistently, or at least detect that it has downloaded a corrupted file and exit nonzero to avoid propagating errors.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2321/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "TomDunn": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2308", "title": "aws cloudformation package command will not output JSON despite documentation", "body": "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-cli-package.html\r\n\r\nIndicates that I should be able to generate a JSON-formatted cloudformation template.

This would seem duplicative of the work/testing that has gone into the `sync` command.\n- Include metadata in separate objects, e.g. /path/to/object and /path/to/object.meta. This isn't the greatest, means I have to pay extra and also manage the metadata within my application.\n- Upload on a per-object basis. This isn't going to be performant for my use case.\n\nWhat would be nice is if I could somehow indicate to the CLI that I want to map each object to a set of metadata, and then upload each object with that metadata. A couple of solutions come to mind:\n- A giant JSON file mapping each key name to a metadata hash e.g.:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"path/to/object1\": {\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2},\n  ...etc...\n}\n```\n\n``` shell\n$ aws s3 sync /some/dir s3://somebucket --metadata-mapping /path/to/meta/mapping.json\n```\n- Some convention for writing metadata locally into a separate file per intended object, and having the `sync` command read the metadata for each object prior to uploading. For example, I could have a local directory:\n\n``` shell\n$ ls /path/to/local/files\nfile1\nfile1.meta\n$ cat file1.meta\n{\n  \"key1\": \"value1\",\n  \"key2\": \"value2\"\n}\n$ aws s3 sync /path/to/local/files s3://somebucket --object-metadata '$filename.meta'\n```\n\n(So when this is run, the `$filename.meta` files would just be read for metadata, and would not be transferred)\n- A callback that takes the local filename as a parameter and spits out the metadata, e.g.\n\n``` shell\n$ ls /path/to/local/files\nfile1\n$ lookup-metadata.py /path/to/local/files/file1\n{\n  \"key1\": \"value1\"\n}\n$ aws s3 sync /path/to/local/files s3://somebucket --metadata-callback lookup-metadata.py\n```\n\nAlternatively, what would be really great is if the syncing functionality were available independently of the CLI from within Python (without requiring me to figure out the internals of how to properly initialize the CLI environment, etc.), so that I could subclass and customize the process. I started going down this route somewhat, but am worried that this API is not for public consumption and would break in the future.\n\nAny thoughts?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/2045/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/1804", "title": "Allow customization of directory where cached credential data is stored", "body": "Currently, this directory is statically encoded as a subdirectory under `~/.aws`.

The [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs#What_data_consistency_model_does_Amazon_S3_employ) states that in this scenario, S3 only guarantees eventual consistency (i.e., an immediate read after the PUT command succeeds is not guaranteed to return the updated version). I would like to use the `s3api wait object-exists` command to wait for the key to be updated, so that I know that the change has propagated.\n\nHowever, it seems that the the `--if*` conditions ( --if-match, --if-modified-since, --if-none-match, --if-unmodified-since) were not designed for this use case. If the condition isn't met, they return immediately. I would expect `s3api wait` to imply that the process would honor its contract ( \"Wait until 200 response is received when polling with head-object.

If the value has been updated (either before the wait command started or during execution), then exit with status 0. If it hasn't changed after 20 checks, then exit status 255.

(Let's say I haven't encountered the difference yet.)\n\nPretty much everything else, including typing on a keyboard on Linux or OS X, uses NFC. I'm not sure about Windows.\n\nOf course this is entirely HFS+'s fault, but since OS X is a popular system among your target audience, I hope you may have some interest in providing a solution to this problem.\n\n**What you can do about it**\n\nI think a `--normalize-unicode` option (possibly with a better name) for `aws s3 sync` would be useful. It would normalize file names read from the local filesystem with `unicodedata.normalize('NFKC', filepath)`.\n\nIts primary purpose would be to interact with S3 on OS X and have file names in NFC form on S3, which is what the rest of the world expects and will cause the least amount of problems.\n\nI don't know `aws cli` well enough to tell which other parts could use this option. I just encountered the problem when trying to replace \"`rsync` to file server\" with \"`aws s3 sync` to S3\".\n\nFWIW `rsync` provides a solution to this problem with the `--iconv` option. A common idiom is `--iconv=UTF8-MAC,UTF8` when rsync'ing from OS X to Linux and `--iconv=UTF8,UTF8-MAC` when rsync'ing from Linux to OS X. `UTF8-MAC` is how `rsync` calls the encoding of file names on HFS+.\n\nHowever this isn't a good API to tackle the specific problem I'm raising here. This API is about the encoding of file names. The bug is related to Unicode normalization. These are different concepts. `UTF8-MAC` mixes them.\n\nThanks!\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/1639/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 5, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "rolandovillca": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/1633", "title": "Cannot get information of Distributions (Behaviors, Error Pages, Restrictions, Invalidations)", "body": "It is not possible, to get cloudfront information of following distributions using aws-cli tool:\nCloudFront Behaviors:\n      \\* Precedence\n      \\* Path Pattern\n      \\* Origin\n      \\* Viewer Protocol Policy\n      \\* Forwarded Query Strings\nCloudFront Error Pages:\n      \\* HTTP Error Code\n      \\* Error Catching Minimum TTL\n      \\* Response Page Path\n      \\* HTTP Response Code\nCloudFront Restrictions:\n      \\* Restriction\n      \\* Status\n      \\* Type\nCloudFront Invalidations:\n      \\* Invalidation ID -> Get successfully\n      \\* Status -> Get successfully\n      \\* Date\n\nnote: I have tried using aws-cli tool without success, Do you know another way or how to get above information via aws-cli tool?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/1633/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "ehammond": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/1611", "title": "Valid MFA token does not work during first 1am hour before daylight savings ends and second 1am hour starts", "body": "I have a number of aws-cli config profiles that let me assume cross-account roles with MFA token.

In fact, it is the equivalent of `base64encode(base64encode(\"test!\"))` as this simple test confirms:\n\n```\n| => echo ZEdWemRDRT0= | base64 -D\ndGVzdCE=\n| => echo ZEdWemRDRT0= | base64 -D | base64 -D\ntest!\n```\n\nSo it seems that the update-item operation is incorrectly assuming that a binary attribute value is not yet base 64 encoded and is applying an additional layer of base64 encoding. In fact, binary values _must_ already be base64 encoded, or it wouldn't be possible to represent them properly in a JSON format in the first place.\n\nAll of this was tested on Max OS X Mavericks:\n\n```\n| => aws --version\naws-cli/1.7.0 Python/2.7.8 Darwin/14.0.0\n```\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/1097/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "smeyfroi": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/1096", "title": "Could strip whitespace from env var credentials", "body": "I just debugged a problem with a bash script that uses the CLI tools with env vars for the credential config.

Create a document object to contain the generated documentation.  At the moment, the only document type is ReSTDocument but there could be others.  The idea is for these documents to provide all of the high-level abstractions (e.g. new_paragraph(), start_ul(), etc.) so that the handler code can just use these high-level abstractions to generate the necessary documentation and not be dependent on any particular format.\n2. Register the event handlers you want to use.  For the main document types (e.g. Provider, Service, Operation) we have event handler classes that contain all of the necessary event handlers for that document type.  So, we can just create an instance of one of those classes and call it's initialize() method to get the handlers registered.  If someone wanted to create a different type of document, or a variation of one of the existing documents they would need to implement and register their own handlers.\n3. Cause the appropriate events to be generated for the type of document you want.  Again, for the standard document types we have built-in functions in `clidocevents.py` to generate the right events in the right order.  If someone needed a different type of document, something other than the current Provider, Service, Operation docs, they would need to implement something to fire the right events in the right order.  They may also have to define some new events.\n\nWe use the `HelpCommand` and it's subclasses to pass state from the CLI to the event handlers.  Anything you need to have when generating the documentation should be added as attributes to the `HelpCommand` object.  The most important thing in the `HelpCommand` is the document container object we created in step 1.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/comments/20201482/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/comments/22601141", "body": "That error is coming from the service and, in general, we want the services to do the majority of the validation.
