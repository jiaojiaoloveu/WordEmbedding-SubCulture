Some have a simplified nullary signature, such as `describeVpcs` (which might take an associated request object for a more detailed query). Some do not, even though their associated request object has only optional attributes, such as `describeEgressOnlyInternetGateways`. Some request classes specify that an attribute is optional, but they do so informally in the docstring. Either way, `describeEgressOnlyInternetGateways` doesn't.\r\n\r\nAn application can statically detect that there's a nullary version of a method, making it easy to deduce that it has only optional arguments. As far as I can tell, an application can not statically detect that `describeEgressOnlyInternetGateways` can be called with no arguments (i.e. it has no required arguments). In the case of the latter, a user ostensibly (I mean, I could be missing how) can't determine if its attribute is optional using the Javadoc either.\r\n\r\nThis information is available in the JSON API descriptions. As far as I can tell from the code gen macros, this isn't exposed in the API via e.g. an annotation. I think it should be: it would make it easier to use the Javadoc to write applications using the SDK manually, and it would also be available for programs to inspect.\r\n\r\nRight now, I'm instead finding JAR files and extracting the JSON resource and parsing it.

I don't see any *ClientOptions for other clients, so if you would like me to implement this approach I'd need a little more guidance on how you see this being used (options passed in the constructor or via a method on the client, etc).\n\nAnother implementation alternative could be to add a protected method in AmazonS3Client to be called from createRequest to determine whether to use path style:\n\n  protected boolean usePathStyleAccess( String bucket, String key ) \n\nThe default implementation would return false, and the method would be overridden to customize the behaviour.\n\nFor my purposes the request style is related to the endpoint in use, so setting on a per-client basis is sufficient. I could see how it may be useful to configure this on a per-request basis though (and using a \"callback\" would allow this flexibility)\n\nSteve\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/12525106/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/12876225", "body": "Created a new pull request with the discussed changes:\n\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/pull/35\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/12876225/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/17580989", "body": "No, feel free to close.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/17580989/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/22510376", "body": "I'd be happy to update for the latest release, I'll aim to get this done by next week.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/22510376/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/23750189", "body": "Submitted under the Apache 2.0 license.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/23750189/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "1zha0": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/12695084", "body": "The API spec of ImportInstanceLaunchSpecification can be found here.\n\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-ImportInstance.html\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/12695084/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "danwashusen": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/13115439", "body": "Sorry, the above is not correct.

So, you exclude the real log4j dependency from the AWS SDK, but then include the fake log4j implementation called log4j-over-slf4j. The AWS SDK is still using log4j classes, but gets bound to the fake ones at runtime, which instead send messages to SLF4J and on to whatever you want like logback.

You want exactly one \"slf4j-XXX\" dependency, since this controls where SLF4J sends its log messages and that can only be one place.  You want the logback binding.\nBut you can have many \"XXX-over-slf4j\" dependencies to grab log messages from different frameworks.

This means that the high-level logic of TransferManager could be stuck in an intermediate state, if the provided ProgressListener#progressChanged calls a blocking method.\n\nFor example, in the repro code shown above, waitForUploadResult() is called inside listener callback, at which point the TransferManager has finished the low-level transfer but hasn't updated its monitor status. As a result, waitForUploadResult() is stuck in an infinite loop while waiting for the monitor status update, and this in turn blocks the main thread to ever update such status.\n\nIn 1.6.0 version, we have fixed this issue by executing all listener callbacks in a separate thread. Also, as part of this change, we have created a new ProgressListener interface in \"com.amzonaws.event\" namespace, which is shared by both Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier clients.

That's what I mean about retry. However, recently I found another duplicated requests issue after stale check is off. I am going to investigate it. Anyway, very appreciate your update.

It uses this to generate the correct import-package headers.\n2) It uses the explicit export-package declarations in the plugin configuration to generate export-package headers. In the pull request I simply exported ALL packages. This is far from ideal, and only classes and interfaces that should be public should be exported. When exporting all packages users can use implementation classes (without even knowing it).\n\nThis all happens during the Maven build.\n\nRequire-Bundle should never be used, this forces users to install specific bundles, instead of letting them choose how to make certain packages available. If the AWS library uses a large amount of external libraries, you might consider embedding these libraries as private packages in the AWS bundle. The bundle size will get larger, but the bundle will be easier to use\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/24392281/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "xpe": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/21233647", "body": "I think this one can be closed out.

I tried uploading files > 5Mb as well as < 5Mb with the same results i.e. it waits indefinitely for an upload result. Interestingly, both uploads succeed and I can see them in the bucket yet waitForUploadResult() never returns.\n\nNOTE: In a previous version I was using (v1.2.1), this never occurred.\n\nDisturbingly, for uploads < 5Mb and when ProgressEvent.COMPLETED_EVENT_CODE fired, upload.isDone() returned \"false\", whilst for uploads > 5Mb upload.isDone() returned \"true\". I would've thought that if the upload has completed that upload.isDone() would always return \"true\". Maybe due to the multi-part nature?\n\nAnyhow, I took 5 thread dumps in case they were of interest to you but can't attach them. If you need them let me know.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm going to need to rollback the version of the AWS SDK until this is resolved OR find a workaround i.e. not use waitForUploadResult()\n\nWould be

The JsonDataConverter included in Flow Framework produces JSON with type information (it uses Jackson JSON Processor under the covers).\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/23914138/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/23975134", "body": "You are correct in pointing out that Flow Framework has additional type information about the parameters that it can pass to the DataConverter. I was trying to clarify that this would not completely solve the problem in the general case and your serialization format would need some type hints for things like collections, derived types etc. Type hints don't have to be language specific, for example in XML you could use xsi:type. I think to properly implement a cross-language use case you would also need some mechanism to express types in a language neutral way that you can then map to types in each of the languages -- protocol buffers and XSD come to mind. \n\nThat said, we will consider exposing the declared parameter types to the fromData method to make it easier to implement custom DataConverters.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/23975134/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "andrecardoso": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/comments/23941443", "body": "Sure.

Based on this and various other use cases, I can't see a reason why metadata needs to be pulled 100% of the time ahead of object itself. Yes, it might be needed _sometimes_, but it's not always needed and there is no way to avoid this extra roundtrip now (which btw was avoidable using earlier versions of AWS SDK, so it should be considered as a regression). Refer (for example to 1.9.25) to https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/5907106c12d49596a971f7db7676f578ed0bea9c/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java#L747 where it was possible to actually use TransferManager without pulling metadata beforehand.\r\n\r\nFirst, object metadata is available as soon as object download process is started as it's delivered as part of HEAD. For the purpose of pause/resume, there is no reason to pull the metadata beforehand as last modification time could be obtained from the object itself when pause action will be triggered because it's part of S3Object which is about to be put on pause (which might not even happened). If download not even started, it's not needed, right?\r\n\r\nContent length could be already known to the client as part of listAvailableObjects() or by other measures and should be used instead of another round trip to the S3 (if available).\r\n\r\nAs for the point 3, it wasn't the case before (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/5907106c12d49596a971f7db7676f578ed0bea9c/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/internal/DownloadImpl.java#L54), so I fail to see why you think it's imperative that metadata is available in advance of S3Object download start (it was never promised). The whole point of introducing this separate instance of object metadata into DownloadImpl is to achieve the retrieval of last modified time for persisting the object (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/internal/DownloadImpl.java#L193). Does it really necessary? If download wasn't started, persist it as 0, if started - pull from the S3Object metadata.\r\n\r\nYes, probably the current solution offered by me is a bit straightforward and nicer one is required, but let's decide how to fix it. I'm open to suggestions.
