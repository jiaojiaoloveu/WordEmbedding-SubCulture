When I say a batch I mean for a 5 minute period I will see this in my logs 30-70 times, then it will go away for several hours or days.  The stack trace is below.  I don't have any throttles or time out events in cloudwatch when this happens.  From reading the documentation it was my assumption that I was doing a \"fire and forget\" invocation of my lambda function therefore my calling function will not stick around and wait for a response.   This started happening as of about the first of the year.  In 2017 I didn't have any of these errors and I haven't changed the way I invoke lambda functions.\r\n\r\nNot sure why my task is being canceled or what I should do about it.  Any advice here would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n```\r\nStackTrace:   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)\r\n   at

It does not happen with non-encrypted snapshots.\r\n\r\nThis issue prevents the command from succeeding. As a workaround, it could be accomplished in 2 steps:\r\n\r\n* Copy the DB snapshot without the tags, then\r\n* Add the tags using `rds:AddTagsToResource`\r\n\r\nBut this is extra steps and extra permissions required.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment where the bug was discovered -->\r\n* AWSSDK.Core version used: 3.3.19\r\n* Service assembly and version used: AWSSDK.RDS 3.3.20\r\n* Operating System and version: Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016\r\n* Visual Studio version: Visual Studio 2017\r\n* Targeted .NET platform: .NET Framework 4.5, 4.6.2\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\nA very similar issue was reported in the AWS CLI here: https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/2860", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/838/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "bluemonkmn": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/837", "title": "LitJson ThirdParty component embedded in AWSSDK.Core behaves badly on MonoAndroid10 build only", "body": "See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48272476/extra-garbage-produced-by-litjson-serialization-with-aws-sdk-for-monoandroid10\r\n\r\nThe serialized JSON code from the LitJson ThirdParty component includes backing fields in the MonoAndroid10 build only for some reason.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nThe example code at https://github.com/LitJSON/litjson/blob/develop/doc/quickstart/guide.md should output:\r\n{\"Name\":\"William Shakespeare\",\"Age\":51,\"Birthday\":\"04/26/1564 00:00:00\"}\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nThe example code outputs:\r\n```\r\n{  \r\n   \"Name\":\"William Shakespeare\",\r\n   \"Age\":51,\r\n   \"Birthday\":\"04/26/1564 00:00:00\",\r\n   \"<Name>k__BackingField\":\"William Shakespeare\",\r\n   \"<Age>k__BackingField\":51,\r\n   \"<Birthday>k__BackingField\":\"04/26/1564 00:00:00\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nConsider removing the integrated third party LitJSON component and including it as a separate externally built dependency. I'm not sure if this will solve the problem, but may simplify diagnosing its source.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\nReference the MonoAndroid10 build of AWSSDK.Core.\r\n```\r\npublic static void PersonToJson()\r\n{\r\n    Person bill = new Person();\r\n\r\n    bill.Name = \"William Shakespeare\";\r\n    bill.Age  = 51;\r\n    bill.Birthday = new DateTime(1564, 4, 26);\r\n\r\n    string json_bill = JsonMapper.ToJson(bill);\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine(json_bill);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nI have already referenced AWSSDK.Core in my Xamarin Android app and decided to use the included JSON parse rather than bloat my application with reference to yet another library.

"Identify if the HttpRequest was cancelled by timeout or cancellation token", "body": "<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\r\nThe method **GetResponseAsync** from the class **HttpWebRequestMessage** (sdk\\src\\Core\\Amazon.Runtime\\Pipeline\\HttpHandler\\_mobile\\HttpRequestMessageFactory.cs) is throwing a TaskCanceledException either for a timeout defined in the HttpClient or when the Cancel method is called in the CancelationTokenSource.

The appender from aws-logger-errors-2.log was actively sending log messages which successfully arrived to AWS CloudWatchLogs, and suddenly it run into credentials expired error.

The credentials are stored by the constructor on behalf of the application software, and are used to make calls to AWS from that client object. Although the credentials are temporary and eventually expire, the SDK client periodically refreshes them so that they continue to enable access. **This periodic refresh is completely transparent to the application software.**\r\n\r\nI see that the issue is gone after restarting the module which uses AWS client, so that the client performs fresh connection to the service. After restart it may happen again after several hours or several days or weeks of normal operation.\r\n\r\nI believe this issue is not the same as [#393](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/393), as the machine clock was NTP synchronized when the issue was observed.\r\n\r\nI am not aware of specific chain of events that lead to this issue, so cannot provide clear steps to reproduce the issue at the moment.\r\n\r\nIn the case of AWS Logger the issue is breaking monitoring cycle for local queue of the log records to be sent to AWS and as a result logging to AWS stops. \r\n\r\nIf the service is used in our own code - we can catch the exception and reconnect to the service.\r\n\r\nIn the logs for AWS Logger, we were using latest version of AWSSDK.Core (3.3.19.0).

I realized that the response marshalers are singletons. I was wondering why the request marshalers haven't been made singletons as well. I analyzed a few and came to the conclusion all of those can be made singletons by design since the state they gatter is per method invication. So I went ahead and changed the generator to turn the request marshalers into singletons as well. This will save an allocation per method call on the SDK for each service.\r\n\r\nFurthermore while testing out my changes I got tired of waiting for the generator so I implemented the generation calls on the driver with a Parallel.ForEach wich drastically reduces the generation time.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n* Less allocations on the hot path (one less object allocation per API call)\r\n* More speed while generating the SDK types\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n* Run the generator and compile the SDK (that's all I did)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

This yields to warnings in VS about how analyzers may not work correctly, and appears to contradict semantic versioning.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nNo warnings from Visual Studio when referencing two versions of AWS SDK assemblies in different projects (which should therefore be isolated from one another)\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nThis causes Roslyn to emit a warning:\r\n>Warning IDE1002 Analyzer assemblies 'C:\\Users\\blah\\\\.nuget\\packages\\awssdk.keymanagementservice\\3.3.3.1\\analyzers\\dotnet\\cs\\AWSSDK.KeyManagementService.CodeAnalysis.dll' and 'C:\\Users\\blah\\\\.nuget\\packages\\awssdk.keymanagementservice\\3.3.2.11\\analyzers\\dotnet\\cs\\AWSSDK.KeyManagementService.CodeAnalysis.dll' both have identity 'AWSSDK.KeyManagementService.CodeAnalysis, Version=3.3.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' but different contents. Only one will be loaded and analyzers using these assemblies may not run correctly.\r\n\r\nThe two assemblies do indeed have the same assembly version and different contents. A SHA1 of the two files yields different results.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nIncrement or match the assembly versions of the analyzer assemblies when they have changed contents.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nSuppress `IDE1002` (which would also conceal any other such analyzer issues). Ideally I'd just turn the analyzer off, but there doesn't appear to be any way to configure this for the new NET Core csproj format.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n- Create 1st new project of NET Standard Library (defaults are fine) e.g. AWS_SDK_Analzyer_Repro1\r\n- Add `<PackageReference Include=\"AWSSDK.S3\" Version=\"3.3.11\" />`\r\n- Create 2nd new project of NET Standard Library (defaults are fine) e.g. AWS_SDK_Analzyer_Repro2\r\n- Add `<PackageReference Include=\"AWSSDK.S3\" Version=\"3.3.0\" />`\r\n- Build\r\n- Go to Visual Studio's `Error List` to see IDE warnings\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nI have a solution that contains migration integration tests. This involves loading an older assembly into a separate process that refers to old AWS SDK assemblies. Thus my overall solution contains two different versions of e.g. `AWSSDK.S3` and `AWSSDK.KeyManagementService`.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio warns that the analyzers are not correctly versioned.\r\n\r\nThis difference may be harmless or not, but the warning suggests the analyzers should follow semantic versioning - if they've changed, they should have a new version?

Ideally, a specific error about the http protocol would be thrown.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nCurrently, if I try to put a record using the AKC from a non-AWS source and have UseHttp set to true on the AmazonKinesisConfig, an XML error page is returned from AWS with a title of \"ERROR: The requested URL could not be retrieved\". This causes an error in the XmlTextReader because it's an HTML document, not a strict XML document (starting with &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?&gt;). Because the stack trace is so large, it's difficult to understand the issue.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nChange error pages returned to the SDK so that they can be interpreted properly. Returning an exception to the user that is quickly actionable is much more effective than what's currently returning.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\n```csharp\r\nAmazonKinesisConfig config = new AmazonKinesisConfig\r\n{\r\n\tRegionEndpoint = RegionEndpoint.USWest2,\r\n\tUseHttp = true\r\n};\r\n\r\nAmazonKinesisClient Client = new AmazonKinesisClient(\"AccessKey\", \"SecretKey\", config);\r\n\r\nstring data = \"Some data I want to put in Kinesis\"\r\nawait PutDataToStream(data);\r\n\r\npublic async Task PutDataToStream(string data)\r\n{\r\n\tusing (var dataStream = new MemoryStream())\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tvar dataBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);\r\n\t\tdataStream.Write(dataBytes, 0, dataBytes.Length);\r\n\t\tdataStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\r\n\r\n\t\tvar request = new PutRecordRequest\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tStreamName = _settings.KinesisStream,\r\n\t\t\tPartitionKey = $\"{DateTime.UtcNow:yyyyMMddHHmmss}\",\r\n\t\t\tData = dataStream\r\n\t\t};\r\n\t\tawait Client.PutRecordAsync(request);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nIn this case, I was trying to test the UseHttp setting to discover if the performance could be increased. I have a different (though similar) case on an aws instance where it's a JSON error instead of XML error, but I'm not receiving the JSON that causes the error in that case.\r\n\r\n## Your

One should not have to learn a different set of rules for each different type of resource which needs to be filtered on.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nThe current state of filtering includes many different requirements across different Cmdlets:\r\n<DL>\r\n<DT>Get-SSMCommandInvocation</DT><dd>Property name: `Key`; Value name: `Value`</dd>\r\n<DT>Get-SSMInstanceInformation<dd>Property name: `Key`; Value name: `Values`</dd>\r\n<DT>Get-EC2Instance<dd>Property name: `Name`; Value name: `Values`</dd>\r\n</DL>\r\n\r\nI suspect further differences, but I'm having trouble tracking down all of the Filter types as some of them have a concrete type of RuntimeType and don't show up when running `Get-TypeData -TypeName 'Amazon.*Filter'`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is no guarantee that a given property may be filtered on. For example, the `Get-SSMCommandInvocation` Cmdlet only supports `\tInvokedAfter`, `InvokedBefore` and `Status` based on the documentation for [CommandFilterKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/v3/apidocs/index.html?page=SSM/TSSMCommandFilter.html&tocid=Amazon_SimpleSystemsManagement_Model_CommandFilter). This limitation is another case which might force a user to need to read the documentation rather than relying on the discoverability which is generally inherent to PowerShell.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nIt's a hard problem to solve for, given the complexities of the types being dealt with. At the very least, I would suggest coming up with a standard, e.g.: `Name`,`Value` and add aliased setters for the classes which currently look for `Name`, or `Values`. Idiomatic PowerShell suggests the use of singular nouns unless there is a guarantee that multiple values will be entered, thus my preference for `Value` over `Values`.\r\n\r\nA longer term solution might be to use some sort of DSL or query language such as JMESPath, which may be familiar to many users due to its use in the AWS CLI.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nGenerally, any time I run into a situation where I need to perform filtering, I need to read the documentation for that particular Cmdlet. This causes significant context switching and, due to the format of the documentation, it may result in hours of searching for the correct method of using the filter. For example, I've been unable to successfully filter on `InvokedAfter` for the `Get-SSMCommandInvocation` Cmdlet as the format accepted by `Value` is extremely hard to find.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n* Powershell version:\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.14393.1066\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.1.14393.1066}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.14393.1066\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n```\r\n* AWSPowerShell version used: \r\n```\r\nName              : AWSPowerShell\r\nPath              : ~\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\AWSPo\r\n                    werShell\\3.3.84.0\\AWSPowerShell.dll\r\nVersion           : 3.3.84.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Service assembly and version used: Unknown\r\n* Operating System and version: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]\r\n* Visual Studio version: n/a\r\n* Targeted .NET platform: n/a", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/661/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "qua-iy": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/711", "title": "UnityMainThreadDispatcher is too heavy to use with high FPS games", "body": "I profiled my game performance on iOS and I found that UnityMainThreadDispatcher is consuming like 0.7 ms every 0.1 second.

That should be re-evaluated, either by allowing us to pass in a ContentLength ourselves somewhere or doing something like a chunked upload so you don't need to set a Content-Length header and thus have no need for a ContentLength from the stream.  \r\n\r\nAlso apparently something is completely blowing up if the stream length that was passed in is 0 as I could easily achieve, that should be

Taaadddaaaaa. \r\n\r\nI tested it and its working well.\r\nHere are the methods i tested and i'm using in my project on Windows and Android (On the object AmazonCognitoIdentityProviderClient) :\r\n- InitiateAuthAsync\r\n- RespondToAuthChallengeAsync\r\n- GlobalSignOutAsync\r\n- SignUpAsync\r\n- ConfirmSignUpAsync\r\n- ResendConfirmationCodeAsync\r\n- ForgotPasswordAsync\r\n- ConfirmForgotPasswordAsync\r\n- ChangePasswordAsync\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is probably some good reasons why all of the services are not available for Unity but i can't find one for CognitoIdentityProvider.\r\n\r\n**So my request is** : Since apparently there is no issues with CognitoIdentityProvider and Unity and very little work to do (literally one line of code + testing), could you add it to the official AWS Unity SDK ? Or am i missing something ?\r\n\r\nOne important note: Use Visual Studio 2017, with the 2015 version its a far more complex process.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/615/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "genuinefafa": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/598", "title": "baseStream \"Argument cannot be null\" on SnsClient.CreatePlatformEndpointAsync ", "body": "Hi there! \r\n\r\nWhile trying to create a platform endpoint, I get an \"Argument cannot be null.

It does so, because the following logic fails to match (because the exception is an `AmazonCognitoSyncException` not a `ResourceConflictException` and because the StatusCode is `BadRequest` (400) not `Conflict` (409).\n\n```\nelse if (ase.GetType() == typeof(ResourceConflictException)\n         || ase.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Conflict)\n{\n    return new DataConflictException(message);\n}\n```\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/430/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/413", "title": "Sync count of local merged data set doesn't match reparented remote dataset.", "body": "On Unity, during a merge, the local dataset and records are copied to a new name (\"dataset.identity\").

On further analysis we have determined that the cause of the problem is the SDK is not retrying requests that timeout regardless of the MaxErrorRetry value configured.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Unit tests have been added to RetryHandlerTests.cs in this pull request\r\n- Further testing has been done by executing a test console app that queries AWS Dynamodb endpoints via a Fiddler proxy. The Fiddler proxy was configured to add a delay to certain requests to induce HTTP timeouts. Analysis of the AWS log output showed that the current Dynamodb client fails to retry on HTTP timeouts but does correctly after applying this pull request.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly\r\n- [x] I have read the **README** document\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover my changes\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed\r\n\r\n## License\r\n- [x] I confirm that this pull request can be released under the Apache 2 license\r\n\r\n[issues]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues\r\n[license]: http://aws.amazon.com/apache2.0/\r\n[cla]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement", "author_association": "NONE"}], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "Singh400": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/pulls/765", "title": "Logging out a malformed service response", "body": "Related to https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/755.\r\n\r\nWhen a service returns a malformed error response we now log out the raw response as well as the request id.\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nAs a part of the investigation and discovery process we now log out malformed service responses.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nTo see what the malformed service response is.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nNA\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nNA\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

This can be done either by reading the data as you are doing it, or with **File.ReadAllBytes**.\n\nOn an unrelated note, when you are creating an instance of **AmazonS3Config** you are setting both **ServiceURL** and **RegionEndpoint**.

(Keep in mind that with this setting null properties will be ignored, and thus nulled-out attributes will remain untouched in DynamoDB.)\n4.

As you pointed out the current implementation uses ISO 8601 UTC format, which does not store the timezone and has a lower precision than is possible with the \"o\" format.\n\nThe original decision to use this format was made across all AWS SDKs that implement a high-level DynamoDB API (Table and DynamoDBContext in .NET, DynamoDBMapper in Java, etc.) Storing dates in ISO 8601 UTC format allows for consistent searching and sorting, which is not possible if timezones are specified: greater string values do not necessarily mean \"greater\" date values, and it is possible to have multiple representations for a single \"unique\" date. The latter can cause issues with all operations, not just searches (Query and Scan): if an item with DateTime as a key is stored with a specific timezone, it can only be retrieved if the same exact timezone is used. So depending on how an application is structured, a change in the timezone may cause all data calls to fail, since the key will not match.\n\nMaking the above change to the .NET SDK will be a breaking change for users who may be using multiple SDKs or different versions of the .NET SDK, since the non-updated clients will be unable to parse the new formats. But the provided converters are an excellent approach to storing higher-precision dates with timezones, as long as the data is consistently read and written using the same formatting and some of the mentioned considerations are taken into account.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/comments/47821543/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/pulls/comments/115791170", "body": "Move this to line 77.\r\nInstead of constructing a lambda here, please add a new method `GetUtcNow`, and set `utcNowSource = GetUtcNow;`", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/pulls/comments/115791170/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/pulls/comments/119437325", "body": "`Boolean.TryParse` should be used here.

The MD5 is use for verifying uploads and in the download area.  Interestingly if you're performing a multi-part upload the MD5 is not checked (see AmazonS3Client.Extensions.cs in the CompareHashes(string etag, byte[] hash) function)\n\nI looked and the fault occurs when a the Init() in the HashingWrapper class is invoked by calling\nHashAlgorithm.Create(algorithmName) where algorithmName is a non compliant algorithm.  The acceptable inputs are listed here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wet69s13%28v=vs.90%29.aspx.  Compliant algorithms are generally not managed and not MD5.  There's some interesting code to list out the compliant ones here http://blogs.msdn.com/b/icumove/archive/2009/01/31/working-with-fips-in-net-c.aspx?Redirected=true\n\nSolution:\nSince the MD5 check is an \"added\" feature and not critical (see the multi-part comments) then we need to detect FIPS and process accordingly.  Note:  I'm using this with the AmazonS3EncryptionClient using asymmetric encryption and signing of the data object, therefore the MD5 hash is redundant. I'm not sure of the MD5s function, see discussion below)\n\nI haven't found a good .Net reference to detect FIPS (like BCryptGetFipsAlgorithmMode function) without calling and catching the error.  When / if that is located the try/catch statements will be changed to if/else.  Until then I performed  the following modifications:\n\n1) Created FipsUtility.cs in Amazon.Util folder and added.  It uses the try/catch instead of an unsafe call to BCryptGetFipsAlgorithmMode.  This uses processes similar to the internal Utils.FipsAlgorithmPolicy.\n\n```\nusing System.Security;\nusing System.Security.Permissions;\nusing Microsoft.Win32;\nnamespace AWSSDK.Amazon.Util\n{\n    public static class FipsUtility\n    {\n        static int fipsAlgorithmPolicy = -1;\n        // Federal Information Processing Standards Publications\n        // at http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/geninfo.htm\n        public static bool RequiresFipsCompliance\n        { \n\n            get\n            {\n                // Check once\n                if (fipsAlgorithmPolicy == -1)\n                { \n                       try\n                        {\n                            System.Security.Cryptography.HashAlgorithm.Create(\"MD5\");\n                            fipsAlgorithmPolicy = 0;\n                        }\n                        catch (System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException)\n                        {\n                            fipsAlgorithmPolicy = 1;\n                        }   \n                } \n                return fipsAlgorithmPolicy == 1;\n            } \n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n 2) In HashStream.cs added a FIPS compliant WrapperClass to the file\n    Note:  This will be unable to compare to the AWS hash and therefore implementation of SHA1 is simply to provide a simple wrapper.  A good modification for S3 might be to return an SHA256 or higher hash.\n\n```\npublic class HashingWrapperGeneric : HashingWrapper\n{\n    //Implement an unmanaged algorythm see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wet69s13%28v=vs.90%29.aspx\n    private static string genericAlgorithmName = \"SHA1\";\n\n    public HashingWrapperGeneric()\n        : base(genericAlgorithmName)\n    { }\n}\n```\n\n  3) In HashStream.cs  I added GenericHashStream to provide a FIPS compliant alternative to MD5Stream\n\n```\npublic class GenericHashStream : HashStream<HashingWrapperGeneric>\n{\n    #region Constructors\n\n    public GenericHashStream(Stream baseStream, byte[] expectedHash, long expectedLength)\n        : base(baseStream, expectedHash, expectedLength) { }\n\n    #endregion\n}\n```\n\n   4) Now that there's a detection of FIPS and an alternative compliant class, we need to add the alternatives.\n\n   4a)  In AmazonS3Client.Extensions.cs  Line 261 the hashStream was changed to create the alternative stream if FIPS is enabled.\n\n```\n                HashStream hashStream; //= new MD5Stream(getObjectResponse.ResponseStream, expectedHash, getObjectResponse.ContentLength);\n                if (AWSSDK.Amazon.Util.FipsUtility.RequiresFipsCompliance)\n                {\n                    hashStream = new GenericHashStream(getObjectResponse.ResponseStream, expectedHash, getObjectResponse.ContentLength);\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    hashStream = new MD5Stream(getObjectResponse.ResponseStream, expectedHash, getObjectResponse.ContentLength);\n                }\n```\n\n   4b)  In AmazonS3Client.Extensions.cs  Line 673 the private static void CompareHashes(string etag, byte[] hash) returns without comparison if the etag is \"-\" (multi part) so I added  a test to return without comparison if FIPS is enabled.  This is because the comparison of a AWS MD5 and local SHA1 will always fail.\n\n```\n    private static void CompareHashes(string etag, byte[] hash)\n    {\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(etag))\n            return;\n        // if FIPS is enabled and we can't\n        // compare the etag to the hash value\n        if (AWSSDK.Amazon.Util.FipsUtility.RequiresFipsCompliance)\n            return;\n        // if etag contains '-' character, the file was a multi-upload and we can't\n        // compare the etag to the hash value\n        if (etag.Contains(\"-\"))\n            return;\n        etag = etag.Trim(etagTrimChars);\n\n        string hexHash = AWSSDKUtils.BytesToHexString(hash);\n        if (!string.Equals(etag, hexHash, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))\n        {\n\n                throw new AmazonClientException(\"Expected hash not equal to calculated hash\");\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n   4c) Update PutObjectRequestMarshaller.cs Line 109 to allow it to use the GenericHashStream class if FIPS is on\n\n```\n            HashStream hashStream;\n            if (AWSSDK.Amazon.Util.FipsUtility.RequiresFipsCompliance)\n            {\n                hashStream = new GenericHashStream(streamWithLength, null, streamWithLength.Length - streamWithLength.Position); \n            }\n            else\n            {\n                hashStream = new MD5Stream(streamWithLength, null, streamWithLength.Length - streamWithLength.Position);\n            }\n```\n\n   4d) Update UploadPartRequestMarshaller.cs Line 74 to allow it to use the GenericHashStream class if FIPS is on\n\n```\n            HashStream hashStream ;\n            if (AWSSDK.Amazon.Util.FipsUtility.RequiresFipsCompliance)\n            {\n                hashStream = new GenericHashStream(partialStream, null, partialStream.Length);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                hashStream = new MD5Stream(partialStream, null, partialStream.Length);\n            }\n```\n\n  The above modification seem to work. I'm still testing it. Given the encryption and signing of the objects use of SHA1 is not an issue for accreditation, it's merely a wrapper.\n\nAmazon S3 MD5 Discussion:\n  I'm trying to identify the threat using the etag with the object externally to AWS mitigates.  Internally it makes perfect sense to track the integrity of objects and having a reference.  Externally by itself the etag is a good resource to inventory the S3 containers unencrypted content without downloading all of the content.  But in this scenario comparing the downloaded object to the etag is either redundant to the transport mechanism or ineffective to MITM attacks since the etag and object use the same transport.  This is the same flaw most sites publishing data and hashes have.  If I can alter the data on the site, or in transit, I can alter the hash too.  A better solution would be signed SHA256 hashes.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/comments/31604608/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "eleven41": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/comments/32808226", "body": "OK then.

For a ASP.NET application (in my case an WebApi MVc Application) means the Thread that receive the Request.\n\nFor us this is VERY IMPORTANT because with ConfigureAwait(false) the code will not hold our threads that are serving the requests.\n\nThe issue is very hard to reproduce. Looks like this only happens with heavy load when something goes wrong while reading the Http Content. \n\nOn our production environment the issue happened everyday and can take from 1 to 6 hour to happen. Our WebApi is receiving an average of 22500 requests per minute with at least 5000 SQS calls and a few hundreds of dynamodb calls. It is calling dozens of queues.\n\nWhen the issue happens an SQS call could take as long as 750 seconds and others request start following with the issue for about 1-3 minutes, sometimes more. With this modification only the issue never happens. We already running the AWS with this custom build for 2 days. \n\nWe don't believe this issue is related to our environment, our code, network or SQS. It is something AWS 2 SDK because after we changed it, everything works fine.\n\nUnfortunately whe can't be using this custom build forever because our project have others dependencies and soon we will need to use the official AWS 2.\n\nThis is issue have a pretty big impact on us. Our system is like a \"service-bus\". Others internal systems use our system. When we have downtime almost all systems stops the business workflow. This make our customers loose money and also the company I work on.\n\nIf possible we recommend someone on your team to see this, This link is a Talk from a Microsoft Enginner\nThe zen of async: Best practices for best performance\nhttp://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/BUILD2011/TOOL-829T\n\nI believe we won't be talking about the same thing if we both don't understand what the link above is trying to explain.\n\nThank you!\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/comments/33822148/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/comments/33954431", "body": "Hello,\n\nIf I'm not wrong, the HTTP Request you do with ConfigureAwait false is here:\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/blob/master/AWSSDK_DotNet45/Amazon.Runtime/AmazonWebServiceClient.cs#L143-144\n\nIs that right?\n\nSince you are using using HttpClient from System.Net.Http you need to read the Content async.
