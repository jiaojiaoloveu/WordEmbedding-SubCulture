In particular I did no vary omega>1 and omega=1, but increased omega0 in the foreground.\r\n\r\nAt a p value cutoff of 0.05, RELAX found 5752 genes with k<1 (true positive rate = 51% ). However, I notice that there are 1657 simulated genes showed p < 0.05 and k>1. A closer inspection showed that the majority of these genes (1492) have parameter estimates of omega0 = 0 for both the foreground and the background clades. Therefore, RELAX has misinterpreted 16.57% of relaxation as positive selection. \r\n\r\nIn my real data, I found that about half the genes with k>1 have parameter estimates of omega0 = 0. So I'm not sure if they should indeed be considered relaxed.\r\n\r\nI am wondering if this is caused by the search constraints of omega0? What happens if you don't allow it to be 0? \r\n\r\nI am attaching 6 example simulated datasets for you to look at.\r\n\r\n[sims.tar.gz](https://github.com/veg/hyphy/files/1606216/sims.tar.gz)\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nRay\r\n  ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/730/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "halabikeren": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/728", "title": "Memory usage in creation, computation and optimization of a likelihood function", "body": "Hey dear team,\r\n\r\nI am experiencing memory issues in the creation and computation/optimization of large likelihood functions (that consist of a codon model, such as RELAX, and multiple alignments and trees).\r\n\r\nThe issue is detectable also when creating a likelihood function with a single alignment and tree, with a simpler, nucleotide model, such as GTR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// process input\r\nalignment_path = io.PromptUserForString(\"\\n>Provide full path to seqData.txt\");\r\ntree_path = io.PromptUserForString(\"\\n>Provide full path to unlabeled_tree.txt\");\r\nDataSet alignment = ReadDataFile(alignment_path);\r\nDataSetFilter data_filter = CreateFilter (alignment, 1);\r\nfscanf(tree_path, \"String\", TreeStr);\r\n\r\n// generate a model\r\nFreqs = {{0.25},{0.25},{0.25},{0.25}};\r\nRateMatrix = {{*,a*t,b*t,c*t}\r\n\t\t\t  {a*t,*,d*t,e*t}\r\n\t\t\t  {b*t,d*t,*,f*t}\r\n\t\t\t  {c*t,e*t,f*t,*}};\r\nModel model = (RateMatrix, Freqs); \r\nTree tree = TreeStr;\r\n\r\n// generate a likelihood function\r\nLikelihoodFunction lf = (data_filter, tree);\r\nfprintf(stdout, \"lf: \", lf, \"\\n\"); \r\n\r\n// compute the likelihood function\r\nnum = io.PromptUser(\"\\n>calling  ComputeLF.

The spike in the computation of the log likelihood and optimization is larger, accordingly.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to bypass this issue? I will state that I am using multiple copies of the same codon alignment in my function (since using a reference of the same copy caused an error when I tried to delete the likelihood function, due to multiple attempts to delete the same data filter). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Is there a way to extract the log likelihood value from the likelihood function, rather than computing it again using estimtors.ComputeLF()? I can see it's already computed in the creation of the likelihood function when I print the instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLog Likelihood =       -4.8e+101;\r\nTree tree=...\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\nKeren\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/728/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/725", "title": "ReadFromString(), ReadFromFile() convert species names when reading a nexsus format", "body": "Hi Dear Team,\r\n\r\nI've noticed that when reading data from a string / file in nexus format, the names of the species are converted to be with upper case:\r\n\r\nFor example, for following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfas_string = \">a1\r\nA\r\n>a2\r\nC\r\n>a3\r\nA\r\n>a4\r\nA\";\r\nDataSet fas_dataset = ReadFromString(fas_string);\r\n\r\nnex_string = \"#NEXUS\r\nbegin data;\r\n\tdimensions ntax=4 nchar=1;\r\n\tformat datatype=dna missing=? gap=-;\r\nmatrix\r\na1       \r\nA\r\na2    \r\nC\r\na3      \r\nA\r\na4  \r\nA\r\n;\r\nend;\";\r\nDataSet nex_dataset = ReadFromString(nex_string);\r\n\r\n\r\nfprintf(stdout, \"fas_dataset: \", fas_dataset, \"\\n\");

I initially uncovered this behavior when I was setting up a model, in which, like HKY85F, I already input frequencies into the matrix. I couldn't find much documentation about the 3rd argument (MULTIPLY_BY_FREQS), so I simply put in a vector of ones for the second Model() argument, just to fully ensure that my matrix would stay the same and not be crossed with any additional frequencies. It was not clear to me the second argument directly corresponds the frequency vector used in the pruning algorithm, so this would explain all the behavior I saw. \n\nHowever, this does raise another point - is there a way in HyPhy to obtain ML estimates for the frequency parameters, rather than using empirical, or empirically-derived, frequencies? I would like to have a set-up where the frequency parameters can be obtained over the course of likelihood optimization as opposed to fixed before-hand from the empirical frequencies.\n\nThanks!\n-Stephanie\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/57327010/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/pulls/comments/103729313", "body": "We are not sure!

Below are what I have tried and the consequent results.\n\n```\n  hyphyInfant-MacBook-Pro:~ hyphyInfant$ locate hyphy\n  /private/var/db/BootCaches/166D217B-D973-4DE8-8DEA-1EC20C8DE77D/app.org.hyphy.playlist\n\n  hyphyInfant-MacBook-Pro:~ hyphyInfant$ cd hyphy\n  hyphyInfant-MacBook-Pro:hyphy hyphyInfant$ HYPHYMPI\n  -bash: HYPHYMPI: command not found\n\n  hyphyInfant-MacBook-Pro:hyphy hyphyInfant $ cp /Users/hyphyInfant/Dropbox/Code/mycode.bf .\n  hyphyInfant-MacBook-Pro:hyphy hyphyInfant$ ls\n  CMakeCache.txt    HYPHYMPI    cmake_uninstall.cmake res\n  CMakeFiles    Makefile    contrib     scripts\n  CMakeLists.txt    README.md   mycode.bf      src\n  CMakeWin32    cmake     help      tests\n  Examples    cmake_install.cmake installers\n\n  hyphyInfant-MacBook-Pro:hyphy hyphyInfant$ mycode.bf\n  -bash: mycode.bf: command not found\n\n  hyphyInfant-MacBook-Pro:hyphy hyphyInfant$ HYPHYMPI\n  -bash: HYPHYMPI: command not found\n\n  hyphyInfant-MacBook-Pro:hyphy hyphyInfant$ hyphy\n  -bash: hyphy: command not found\n\n\n  hyphyInfant-MacBook-Pro:hyphy hyphyInfant$ HYPHYMPI --version\n  -bash: HYPHYMPI: command not found\n\n  hyphyInfant-MacBook-Pro:hyphy hyphyInfant$ $HYPHYMPI /Users/hyphyInfant/Dropbox/Code/mycode.bf\n  -bash: /Users/hyphyInfant/Dropbox/Code/mycode.bf: Permission denied\n\n  hyphyInfant-MacBook-Pro:hyphy hyphyInfant$ sudo $HYPHYMPI /Users/hyphyInfant/Dropbox/Code/mycode.bf\n  Password:\n  sudo: /Users/hyphyInfant/Dropbox/Code/mycode.bf: command not found\n```\n\nSo sorry for causing you headaches,\nhyphyInfant.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/49583197/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/49656184", "body": "Thank you Steve,\n\nThe first option i.e. \n\n```\n ./HYPHYMPI /Users/hyphyInfant/Dropbox/Code/mycode.bf\n```\n\nworks perfectly fine but the\n\n```\n sudo make install HYPHYMPI\n```\n\noption fails.

The second argument indicates whether or not you also want the **index** of the element which yields the value. \nIf you set the second argument to a non-zero value, the return value will be a 2-element vector, with the [0] index storing the max/min value, and the [1] index storing the index in the original vector where this element can be found.\n\n```\nvector = {{10,4,-5,21,0}};\n\nfprintf (stdout, \"\\nVector min = \", \n                 Min (vector, 0), \n                 \"\\nVector max = \", \n                 Max (vector, 0), \n                 \"\\n\");\n\nfprintf (stdout, \"\\nVector max with index = \", Max (vector, 1), \"\\n\");\n```\n\n#### Reading Excel data\n\nIf you export an Excel sheet to a CSV or a tab-separated file, you can use the functions in **ReadDelimitedFiles** to read it in. For example\n\n```\nLoadFunctionLibrary (\"ReadDelimitedFiles\");\n\ncsv_data = ReadCSVTable (\"test.csv\", 1);\n\nfprintf (stdout, \"\\nColumn headers:\", csv_data[0],\n                 \"\\nTable data:\", csv_data[1], \"\\n\");\n```\n\nIf you pass an empty string as the first argument to **ReadCSVTable**, HyPhy will prompt you for a file; the second argument controls if you expect the CSV file to have a row of headers.\n\n#### Generating random values from a Gaussian.\n\nThe **ProbabilityDistribution** has a function to sample from the standard normal using the Box-Muller transform. To generate normal deviates with mean mu and std.dev sigma, all you have to do is linearly transform your samples. \n\n```\nLoadFunctionLibrary (\"ProbabilityDistributions\");\n\n// populate a vector with standard normals\n// the syntax below simply applies the formula 'sampleFromNormal'\n// to each entry in the matrix\n\nrandom_normal_values = {1000, 1} [\"sampleFromNormal()\"]; \n\nmu = 10;\nsigma = 0.1;\n\n// transform the deviates using matrix arithmetic\n\nrandom_normal_values = random_normal_values * sigma + mu;\n\n// confirm that we got what we wanted\n\nLoadFunctionLibrary (\"DescriptiveStatistics\");\n\nPrintDescriptiveStats (\"Random deviates with mean \" + mu + \" and std.dev \" + sigma,\n                        GatherDescriptiveStats (random_normal_values));\n```\n\n#### Gaussian density and CDF\n\nYou can always define the standard Gaussian density as a function (it is not a part of the ProbabilityDistributions file, which I realize is not what you would expect), and its cumulative distribution function (in terms of the error function), and then simply call them to get the density values, and percentiles. For example:\n\n```\n// lfunction will give the variables inside the function a local scope         \n\nlfunction GaussianDensity (x, mu, sigma) {\n    return Exp (- (x-mu)^2 * 0.5 / sigma^2) / sigma / Sqrt (8*Arctan (1));\n}\n\nfunction GaussianPercentile (prob, mu, sigma) {\n    // ZCDF is the standard normal cumulative distribution function\n    // FindRoot is documented here http://hyphy.org/w/index.php/FindRoot\n    FindRoot (z, ZCDF ((t-mu)/sigma) - prob, t, -100, 100);\n    return z;\n\n}\n\nfor (x = 0; x < 5; x+=0.5) {\n    fprintf (stdout, \"Normal (\", x, \", mu = \", 2, \", sigma = \", 1.5, \") = \",\n                      GaussianDensity (x, 2, 1.5), \"\\n\");\n}\n\nfor (x = 0.05; x < 1; x+=0.05) {\n    fprintf (stdout, Format (x*100, 5, 0), \" percentile of Normal (mu = \", 2, \", sigma = \", 1.5, \") = \",\n                      GaussianPercentile (x, 2, 1.5), \"\\n\");\n}\n```\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/46876117/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/47615641", "body": "Hi all,\n\nThanks Martin for an excellent answer, to which I would only add that you can use `HYPHY_LIB_DIRECTORY` as a predefined path to where HyPhy keeps its template files, so you could use something like\n\n```\n  fileToExe = HYPHY_LIB_DIRECTORY + \"TemplateBatchFiles\" + DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR + \"FUBAR.bf\";\n```\n\nSergei\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/47615641/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/47616143", "body": "Hi hyphyinfant,\n\nTo calculate the likelihood of an individual site you would use `ConstructCategoryMatrix`.

You can use this trick to expand it into a vector of individual draws (this code should be made into a function if reused, of course)\n\n```\n// now convert these replicates to a serial sample\n\nserial_samples = {1,number_of_draws};\n\nsample_index = 0;\ncurrent_value = 0;\nfor (;;) {\n    if (sample_index == binned_replicates[current_value][1]) {\n        current_value += 1;\n        if (current_value == unique_values) {\n            break;\n        } \n        binned_replicates[current_value][1] += binned_replicates[current_value-1][1];\n    }   \n    serial_samples [sample_index] = binned_replicates[current_value][0];\n    sample_index += 1;\n\n}\n\n// Randomize ordering\n\nserial_samples = Random (serial_samples, 0);\n\nfprintf (stdout, serial_samples, \"\\n\");\n```\n\nSergei\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/48934829/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/49075184", "body": "Hi CJY,\n\nA few small points to add to Konrad's list\n\nFDR procedures **estimate** something about the distribution of p-values under the null using the p-values you get from the tests. This makes two assumptions: that many (if not most) the the data come from the null, and that the p-values obtained from different tests are directly comparable. Neither assumption is particularly appropriate for MEME\n1. The test is generally conservative, i.e. you have to simulate data with dN/dS = 1 on a subset of branches to hit nominal p-values. For real data you either have strong conservation or positive selection, so truly neutral data are rare. This will likely skew your q-value estimates to be more conservative than needed.\n2. When you start comparing p-values derived from different genes, you are mixing apples and oranges. Genes have different information content, i.e. MEME will have more or less power to detect the same effect size based on the number of sequences, divergence levels, tree shapes, etc. I am not sure what this will do to q-value estimation, but probably nothing good.\n3. Consider the following thought experiment. You have a fixed number of sequences N (say 100) and because MEME derives power from a single site (i,e. its power is a function of N), say the minimum p-value you can realistically see if 10<sup>-5</sup>. Now as you start analyzing more and more genes, FDR or any other sequential rejection procedure will almost surely return an empty list of selected sites when the number of genes becomes large enough. In other words, the more data you get the less power you have to detect selection. This goes back to what Konrad was saying about how stringent you want to be, but you either have to keep driving the p-value down, or accept that the more tests you, the more false positives you will have, i.e. you control the **proportion** of false positives, but not the number.\n\nSergei\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/49075184/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/49259085", "body": "Yeah, that was a brain fart.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/49259085/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/49943447", "body": "Yay!

A correction over multiple genes would be appropriate if you were asking the question `Is there evidence of episodic selection somewhere in a given gene?`. BS-REL, FUBAR, and MEME should not be used to answer this question, because they deliver branch- or site- level answers and combining them into gene-level answers would both lose power and be a misuse of the methods (even though some [published papers](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/10/16/molbev.mst198.short)  have done just that to my chagrin). If you **do** want to ask a gene-level question, we have a method that we are going to write-up and publish soon to do just that.\n\nSo I would simply report the results for individual genes but avoid making claims that evidence of selection at a site/branch is a formal hypothesis test for selection on the gene as a whole.

And it made me think more with this p < 0.05 we all (well at least I have) follow by heart. In fact the reason why I was thinking of the second method was that I wanted to avoid making too much multiple comparisons as possible and try to avoid thinking the problem with multiple comparisons. \nSo say for example I want to see if genes in glucose metabolism evolve faster then sucrose metabolism (and lets say that we have good reasons to believe genes involved in sucrose metabolism are likely to be under more constraint), from here my plan was to conduct MEME analysis (and potentially FUBAR) on all genes that are involved in glucose metabolism and sucrose metabolism. If the evolutionary pressure on a gene is close to neutral (however more likely to be under negative selection) I would assume fewer instances of high lnL per gene and this logic is then extended to groups of genes. Thus by comparing the distribution of lnL values of glucose metabolism gene and sucrose metabolism genes my thought was that one could than answer and accept or reject the null hypothesis \"There is no difference in the number of sites with significant episodic selection between the glucose and sucrose metabolism system\".\n\nHowever reading Sergei's second comment perhaps grouping lnL values of different genes is not recommended. What if one conducted simulations to create a dataset of neutral sequences and the lnL values from that sequences used as a null distribution (used in some genome wide phylogenetic studies)? \n\nThank you once again for great suggestions!\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/49092619/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/50016505", "body": "Hi Sergei\n\nI've tried it out on lysin.nex data and it works like a charm!\nThanks again!\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/50016505/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "DCarlson86": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/47723508", "body": "Hi All,\n\nI'm looking to do something similar to what cjy8709 is doing.

For a good discussion of the thinking behind FDR in this context, see this blog post by Nicolas Lartillot: http://bayesiancook.blogspot.com/2014/04/fdr-and-single-gene-experiment.html\n\nTo add to what Nicolas said, it makes sense to think about what one wants when reporting a list of sites:\n\nDo you want to be reasonably confident that the list contains absolutely _no_ false positives? In that case, a traditional multiple test correction controlling the family-wise error rate is the right thing to do, and will often lead you to report an empty list. This is as it should be: if you really think a single false positive invalidates the entire list, you need to err on the side of caution and in many cases an empty list will be the only way to do this. Success!\n\nOn the other hand, it seems very unlikely that this is what most people want. Typically, we all accept that biology is noisy and that false positives will occur - if we are willing to tolerate a list of sites that contains false positives (provided we know roughly how many items on the list are likely to be false positives, even though we don't know _which_ ones they are), we can produce a much more informative list. This is what FDR is for.\n\nNow, we could go with a q-value threshold of 0.05, producing a list that is roughly 95% true positive and 5% false positive, but that is still very conservative and will still often result in an empty list. Do we really want to be that stringent? In the end it depends on what you want to use the list for, but for most purposes we can imagine a list containing 80% true positives (q-value threshold of 0.2) or even 50% true positives (q-value threshold of 0.5) being useful. So I would pick a less stringent q-value threshold (guided by the purpose of the study) and report the list along with an estimate of the expected number of false positives on the list (the q-value threshold will give an upper bound; the sum of the actual q-values on the list gives a direct estimate of the number of false positives).\n\nAs for the second question, what you are proposing would be an ad hoc approach that may have some validity to it, but would be hard to interpret as it does not give a direct answer to a specific question. I am especially concerned that simply aggregating the answers to a set of site-level questions is unlikely to be a good way to answer a gene-level question. The main problem is that it is not clear which question you have in mind with \"if there are significantly more episodic selection in a specific gene family\". Do you mean more sites with at least given strength of episodic selection? Or stronger episodic selection on average (you would need to specify what you mean by \"average\" - the presence of purifying selection complicates things)? Or more time spent (on average per site) under positive selection? Etc. etc: there is an endless variety of questions one can come up with, any of which arguably captures something of what you're getting at. The beauty of the probabilistic approach is that we can build a model to answer any of these questions directly, but first you have to decide what the question really _is_.\n\nHope this helps,\nKonrad Scheffler\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/49073281/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "MiguelArenas": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/50502914", "body": "Dear Sergei,\n\nFor example, I just multiplied all the elements of the matrix provided in \"WAG_F.mdl\" by 1, 10 and 100. Please find these files in https://www.dropbox.com/s/t59ie7oabhe8526/Hyphy_proof.zip\nThere just paste your HYPHY executable and run ./HYPHY RunMe_AA_ASRperSite.bf\nIn the line 102 of this batch file you can replace the matrix file, for example to \"WAG_F_mod2.mdl\", \"WAG_F_mod2.mdl_mod_SCALE10.bf\" or \"WAG_F_mod2.mdl_mod_SCALE100.bf\", which are the same matrix multiplying by 1, 10 and 100, respectively. This script will apply the matrix for every site (.fas files with the ASR for each site will be also printed) and at the end of the run, the log likelihood is printed on the screen. This is for a Project where our lab is now involved.\nSo, the results are the following:\nScale factor = 1 (so the matrix is not modified), LogL=-1247.18\nScale factor = 10, LogL=-1273.86\nScale factor = 100, LogL=-1443.1\nIf the scale factor is < 1 the likelihood can be improved respect to the original matrix but if the factor is really small again the likelihood is worse.

I am not sure what you mean by associations between invariant positions and mutations: is it that change at position X is associated with LACK of change at position Y?\n\nSergei\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.                    =\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/61021204/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "irum2014": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/61221983", "body": "Dear,Actually i need to implement SLIDING WINDOW ANALYSIS TOOL (Standard Analysis ---> Miscellaneous ---> Slidind Window Analysis.bf) on my codon file.

However, when I try to use the base frequencies and branch lengths outputted from your script to do this, I get a set of sequences with very different base frequencies to those in my data set. \n\nI think this is because the base frequencies the script outputs are not describing rates of change along a branch, but instead describe starting frequencies for each branch. \n\nAlthough I\u2019d imagine that it should be straight forward, I\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t quite understand how the rates are estimated in this model well enough to edit the script to get the actual rate estimates out. I\u2019m not really sure what the n_r01 and n_r10 values are, since they seem to be able to be greater than 1. I\u2019m also confused about how length is estimated by f0 \\* n_r01 + (1-f0) \\* n_r01 (I would have though it would be f0 \\* n_r01 + (1-f0) \\* n_r10).\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nGemma\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/61976190/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "Jubilox": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/62151261", "body": "Hi Sergei,\n\nThank for replying so quickly.\nYes, that is exactly what it is.\nHere is the link:\nhttp://www.datamonkey.org/spool/upload.677937869214474.1_bsr.php\n\nThanks again!\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/62151261/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/62481072", "body": "Hi Sergei,\nI know you must be really busy, but did you had a chance to look into the link I sent?\nThanks!\nBest,\nJubilox\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/veg/hyphy/issues/comments/62481072/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}}}}
