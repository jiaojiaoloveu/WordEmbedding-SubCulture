Indeed it works, I just tried and I have log messages including the threadname. Now, a suggestion, that you may or may not consider worth of tracking via an Issue.\r\nBy using an AMQP reader program it can be found that a number of different log message fields are mapped to the AMQP message header structure as in this sample: \r\n```\r\n#contentHeader<basic>(\r\ncontent-type=text/plain, \r\ncontent-encoding=UTF-8, \r\nheaders={\r\n     level=TRACE, \r\n     location=es.companyname.logging.demo.WriteLogs.main()[23], \r\n     categoryName=es.tsystems.logging.demo.WriteLogs\r\n}, \r\ndelivery-mode=2, \r\npriority=0, \r\ncorrelation-id=null, \r\nreply-to=null, \r\nexpiration=null, \r\nmessage-id=null, \r\ntimestamp=Thu Aug 10 14:02:03 CEST 2017, \r\ntype=null, \r\nuser-id=null, \r\napp-id=logging-amqp-log4j, \r\ncluster-id=null\r\n)\r\n```\r\nWhen indexing and storing the logs via Logstash and Elasticsearch, for example, there will be always the need of obtaining the threadname, so that each execution path can be isolated for browsing, f.e. with Kibana.\r\n\r\nWith the patternlayout, now I have log messages as follows:\r\n```\r\n\"message\":\"2017-08-11 17:37:38,104  INFO [pool-1-1] END something to log in one thread\\r\\n\"\r\n```\r\nIf I want to obtain the threadname ( 'pool-1-1' in the example), I need to code in logstash a filter to get it out of the message text. Not difficult, but error prone and dependent on message layout. Would it make more sense to have it included in the 'headers' structure, together with 'level', 'location' and 'categoryName'?\r\n\r\nThe other thing that strikes me is to see that '\\r\\n' at the end of each text message, I am not including a carriage feed at the end of the log messages, so, why is it there?\r\nThanks again!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-amqp-samples/issues/comments/321853498/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-amqp-samples/issues/comments/321860646", "body": "Yes, that was it...
