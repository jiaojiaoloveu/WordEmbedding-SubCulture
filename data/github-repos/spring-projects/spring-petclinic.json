It is natural to navigate those objects in a rather imperative style, i.e. fetching the parent, and then iterating its children, possibly letting the ORM figure out what to fetch eager or lazy (hint: it's mostly wrong by default and needs tuning).\n\nIn a SQL approach (JDBC / SpringJDBC / jOOQ / etc.), you would do things very differently. You would think of your data as sets (or bags) of tuples (or rows), which you materialise all at once as required. You wouldn't fetch the pets and visits individually. You'd either:\n- Join them.\n- Fetch both sets in 2 queries and join them in memory.\n- Nest sets via the `MULTISET` operator (unfortunately, not supported in many databases)\n\nIn fact, you probably wouldn't even make use of any extra DTOs which are just boilerplate in a SQL context. You'd pass the sets of tuples directly to the UI. If writing back to the database is required (it is here), then you'd probably use an active record pattern as implemented by jOOQ, to store the results that are modified by the UI directly, instead of expressing `INSERT` and / or `UPDATE` statements.\n\nI'm aware that such a change would be a lot of work, but Spring has a lot of responsibility as well. You guys are an inspiration for a lot of programmers, many of which are not yet very experienced.\n\nMy take here is that if you're showing them the JDBC solution as it is now, they will get things wrong. They will think that JPA and JDBC are \"similar\", instead of learning to think in terms of sets and set theory, as they should when working with SQL...\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/issues/comments/105826307/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/issues/comments/106209750", "body": "> In case we would like to go that way, would you be interested to do it?\n\nOnly if I can contribute a jOOQ branch, too :) (disclaimer: I work for Data Geekery / jOOQ)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/issues/comments/106209750/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/issues/comments/106229011", "body": "Note that jOOQ is commercial, but ASL 2.0 (dual-)licensed.\n\nHere's some help for your argumentation showing how other commercial products can add value to Spring :)\nhttps://spring.io/blog/2014/10/01/webinar-building-bootful-uis-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/issues/comments/106229011/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "felixbarny": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/issues/comments/87231460", "body": ":+1: LGTM\nWhen is this going to be merged?
