Fixed in https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/commit/519ddeeb8d3757c97c9c61f2a871251970268aa2\n\nNote that we switched to heirloom mailx (the version of mailx available in normal rhel channels).  This breaks existing installs that have bsd-mailx.  I've created an UPDATING.md to document issues like these.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25736710/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25740125", "body": "retest\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25740125/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25740216", "body": "retest\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25740216/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25740371", "body": "retest\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25740371/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25741537", "body": "retest\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25741537/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25741570", "body": "retest\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25741570/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25747727", "body": "retest\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25747727/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25748516", "body": "This was solved by https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/pull/193\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25748516/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25750391", "body": "manually ran jenkins ftw; hooks are not working right now.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25750391/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25750397", "body": "fixed by https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/pull/194\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25750397/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25828103", "body": "this is an issue for claco.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25828103/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25834485", "body": "retest\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25834485/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-private-cloud/issues/comments/25916865", "body": "Making a new issue to track this and syslog-ng restarts for future milestones.

When you start to add things like yum:epel from osops, and then the rcb repos, the ntp install line gets longer and longer. This is because the package resource is dumping a list of all available packages, then comparing the installed version to that list to see if there is an upgrade available. The more repos, the longer the list, the longer the first call to package is. If you add another package install in a prior recipe, that resource becomes the one that takes a long time, etc. \n\nThere seem to be a few tickets around makecache and the yum book.
