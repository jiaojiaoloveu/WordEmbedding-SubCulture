It's not designed to distinguish which variable should go where.\r\n\r\n/cc @sytses @vsizov @dzaporozhets \r\n\r\nSee merge request !227"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/faee0750d08787993727f10a008c70aa63f8814c", "message": "Update documentation"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/3ee72501882a48b89f14a58f0c6093d35c7bf9cd", "message": "Merge branch 'service-testing' into 'master'\r\n\r\nFix service testing\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci/issues/248\r\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci/issues/208\r\n\r\n/cc @vsizov \r\n\r\nSee merge request !221"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/6d8482b11b38135cf2a72a3ac923dbc102c3e950", "message": "Satisfy rubocop"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/9cce83b1290826ad19acffb6e095a0e8b963c05f", "message": "Added support for YAML-defined variables"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/9d95dfe6018a6d039bc4f0d9ff42131b0ff9505c", "message": "Merge branch 'fix-projects-api-empty-list' into 'master'\r\n\r\nFix project API listing returning empty list when first projects are not added to CI\r\n\r\nThe CI prefers to receive the projects added to CI first\r\n\r\n/cc @vsizov \r\n\r\nSee merge request !225"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/1779c1d49f36fe255adcc12764b70561ecb5c351", "message": "Fix specs"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/abfa9b41dbd4c8d107ff6d8e37579bde112143b5", "message": "Fix project API listing returning empty list when first projects are not added to CI\n\nThe CI prefers to receive the projects added to CI first"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/0ac87af6ce25abf7e12a63a9cec1a2d10c841196", "message": "Merge branch 'skipped_commit' into 'master'\r\n\r\nCommits with [ci skip] have special skipped status\r\n\r\n![Screen_Shot_2015-07-30_at_14.02.50](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci/uploads/f200af385679b564cd15d730bd4ccd20/Screen_Shot_2015-07-30_at_14.02.50.png)\r\n\r\n+ Commits with [ci skip] are marked as skipped\r\n+ Commits without builds are marked as skipped\r\n\r\nResolution for:\r\n+ https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-ci/issues/264\r\n+ https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-ci/issues/266\r\n\r\nThis requires CE update:\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/1073\r\n\r\n/cc @vsizov @sytses \r\n\r\nSee merge request !216"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/9c0c4fd0af7353f72a4a2bc8b3767c1594cc23f7", "message": "Merge branch 'rename-type-to-stage' into 'master'\r\n\r\nRename type to stage\r\n\r\nHowever, make the `type` and `types` as alias for `stage` and `stages`.\r\n\r\n/cc @vsizov @sytses \r\n\r\nSee merge request !222"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/7f81666114e1a108bb57374b0201ea8dda621c3e", "message": "Fixed specs"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/a25cd51d33cf26059c9938d2be261f40f80c180b", "message": "Commits without builds are marked as skipped"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/a5c6bf0317d69d5e385ac1afd72f6c294bc7a004", "message": "Commits with [ci skip] have special skipped status"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/d013642b2830171816a62a0c5aa3b51c12a7a2e8", "message": "Rename create_builds_for_type to create_builds_for_stage in Commit model"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/bc0c94e7aaad67f8041c701b203ea3d912355498", "message": "Merge branch 'remove-unused-entities' into 'master'\r\n\r\nRemove unused entities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee merge request !224"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/99d6329a7ce34e7242a2d2f1af7846360699463f", "message": "Merge branch 'access-token-api' into 'master'\r\n\r\nRefactor access_token usage for API requests\r\n\r\nThis MR refactors GitLab API usage to use either access_token or private_token.

The difference between current version and latest version is in multiple security and bug fixes as well as some features, see [their changelog](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rdoc).\n\nReason why I've created this MR is that upgrading to 1.6.6.2 removes warnings about libxml version mismatch when running ci rake tasks in omnibus as shown here: gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab#636 .\n\nSee merge request !179"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/4dcfbe5f5d1cce0e5cbd943e69f46d39a591ba3d", "message": "Merge branch 'status_badge' into 'master'\n\nBuild status Badge: unable to obtain code\n\nhttps://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-ci/issues/304\n\nSee merge request !177"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/f2331e53de2cb98475e3306052dcdf3b2db2f430", "message": "Fix status badge"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/6c2922c6b031e39ad8b23d71f61edc20094ce976", "message": "Merge branch 'better_yaml_validation2' into 'master'\n\nImproved validation of .gitlab-ci.yml\n\nhttps://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-ci/issues/305\n\nSee merge request !176"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/1ce4563833d3a510382481c4cba2a96d0d67813e", "message": "Improved validation of .gitlab-ci.yml"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/5d4a6b9996001f18eb5e28b23beb912c0ae63793", "message": "Merge branch 'only_section' into 'master'\n\nFix list of branches in only section\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci/issues/195\n\nSee merge request !174"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/5d14d52507352a4a0cb614f948dabbd85cc68298", "message": "fix list of branches in only section"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/64afa20360bbd4a086305282c2a82e42614a615c", "message": "coverage minor fix"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/c4657e482bfe68b59235214220a9aa294b16d104", "message": "Merge branch 'coverage_fix' into 'master'\n\nFix coverage colcalation on the commit page\n\nSee merge request !171"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/744d291de7f7387564900c77999d6d6b712e1837", "message": "fix coverage calculation on commit page"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/07383304a5d0593875025c3317e1914efe74b7f6", "message": "Merge branch 'rake_env' into 'master'\n\nImplemented rake env:info\n\nhttps://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-ci/issues/298\n\nSee merge request !172"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/6427e19f5b05fab40f462162ecca4f1aaa0f9c05", "message": "update changelog"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/497c832b8d7dc10945d92179c02178061c460562", "message": "implemented rake env:info"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/d4848d8f29da286f45338088b3f901544d3584c8", "message": "update documentatioon"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/b34f96ec2a4a0d09d35f562aa18eb91071d95b2f", "message": "spec minor fix"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/e639ad7f74f0eb27bdd5256c568618c580da6cb4", "message": "update changelog"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/77d67c0689abe04ffe9d736012518ecfae028f1e", "message": "ad builds to gitignore"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/5dbba537353f7111ca2dc8f6ed6930f88d904108", "message": "build trace in file"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/7ae983a91b19624539c03f5d82719218e27e8ecf", "message": "update changelog"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/56c8f2a5586d2f5659f32d260612f2aec48a5309", "message": "silent rake backup for CRON"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/7c71fe9c3cf64972bb03f74fb0bcb76b9a38ecac", "message": "cleaning up specs"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/a6454082c456d5824012444be0977c34b0d51a87", "message": "Merge branch 'show_warning_about_yaml' into 'master'\n\nWarning when .gitlab-ci.yml not found\n\nhttps://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-ci/issues/295\n\n![joxi_screenshot_1435155049429](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci/uploads/83e34bba9bb7cb69d0fc663ee1077605/joxi_screenshot_1435155049429.png)\n\nSee merge request !164"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/8164acebd7adfd3cc3e80f9750a4ce88e28399ce", "message": "warning when .gitlab-ci.yml not found"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/commits/aec639d33b404ed4e1e587ea181cd65af5e5314e", "message": "Merge branch 'commit_not_found_error' into 'master'\n\nExplicit error when commit not found\n\n!!!
