Sorting that out, it seems there is a bug related to static linking of these libraries, found here:\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=354463\nI tried the work-around suggestion in the report, but then I had linking issues with gfortran.\n\nHence, right now my feeling is that we should do to different builds. Static linking for Red Hat and dynamic linking for any other distro (assuming people running other distros are able to install dependencies, which we could cater to with packaging of course). Not sure how easy this is to accommodate in the make file, maybe using the build types is the easiest (e.g., release, debug, etc), having one for dynamic linking and one for static linking?

Atlas is not installed by default, and we had one frustrated user just last week. Users cannot be bothered with dependencies, and it is not realistic to have atlas installed on every node. Moreover, we need to distribute it with binaries (i.e., not through rpms which can handle dependencies). Hence, either we have to host the dynamic libraries on network disks and set-up environment variables for library path (which is a hassle in itself), or we need to link statically (in which case the binaries just works on any node).\n\nWe did try the static option to gcc (which worked nicely before). However, pthread gave errors preventing the code from running, so this is not really an option. Ulrich Drepper had long rants about static linking and why he did not like it. The Linux standard base basically dictates that a number of libraries should be linked dynamically, most notable glibc (for which Ulrich was responsible for a number of years), while libraries that cannot be expected on hosts should be linked statically.\n\nLong story short, the most practical solution for Red Hat is linking Atlas statically, while linking the rest dynamically, just like we set it up when Marit and myself tried to get this working smoothly over here. What worked for years before did not have multi-threading (no pthread) and statically linking applied to the Intel libraries (which is the typical modus of operandi for Intel libs), things are different today, for the better I hope.\n\nConsider having smooth Red Hat set-up the default build option, rather than treating it as a corner case needing odd command line parameters fed to make.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/CRAVA/crava/issues/comments/20494517/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/CRAVA/crava/issues/comments/125346045", "body": "It compiles on just about any linux distribution.

The default wavelet length in CRAVA is 200ms. And the CRAVA estimated wavelet should usually be close to 200ms. But there are some cases CRAVA estimate wavelets which are as long as 2000ms.

Which you fix at 2.8.\nIf this is the case this is not a good practice. If you want to run CRAVA with an estimated wavelet and a given\nSignal to noise ratio,  you should run CRAVA in estimation mode, to get the Estimated wavelets and then use these\nwavelets as input to the model, together with a fixed signal to noise ratio.\n(You do the same for several stacks)\n\nOdd\n\nFrom: ganpan [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nSent: 29. oktober 2013 15:55\nTo: CRAVA/crava\nCc: Odd Kolbj\u00f8rnsen\nSubject: Re: [crava] wavelet length estimated too long (#47)\n\nHi, FYI.

The default wavelet length in CRAVA is 200ms. And the CRAVA estimated wavelet should usually be close to 200ms. But there are some cases CRAVA estimate wavelets which are as long as 2000ms. It will easily end to an abortion because there are usually no wells have such long continuous logs.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/CRAVA/crava/issues/47.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/CRAVA/crava/issues/47#issuecomment-27307618.\n\n---\n\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is\nintended for the addressee only.

The default wavelet length in CRAVA is 200ms. And the CRAVA estimated wavelet should usually be close to 200ms. But there are some cases CRAVA estimate wavelets which are as long as 2000ms. It will easily end to an abortion because there are usually no wells have such long continuous logs.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/CRAVA/crava/issues/47.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/CRAVA/crava/issues/47#issuecomment-27307618.\n\n---\n\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is\nintended for the addressee only.
