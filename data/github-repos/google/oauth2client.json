Hence they are a different type from one to the other.\n- The convenience method of casting to a string `str(e)` or `'%s' % val` is used without an idea of what the value actually is. In Py3, `str(b'a') == \"b'a'\"`. It's very clear just from the changes I had to make that the most parts of the code assume Python2 strings.\n\nAlso, it seems to me that one of the reasons the tests seem slow is file I/O. There is a nontrivial amount of reading from the `DATA_DIR` which could be replaced with a module containing the actual content. I somewhat understand wanting tests to actually make sure that file I/O is working, but it is so low-level it isn't really necessary to test (though `open(filename)` with no mode actually happens in this library :cry:).\n\nI don't think the people who gave Python3 support read this:\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/oauth2client/issues/comments/65909582/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/oauth2client/issues/comments/66167797", "body": "@craigcitro Can you re-open this (I don't have owner privileges)?

A rough idea of what this package will look like is:\n- `google.auth.default()` returns the application default credentials.\n- `google.auth.service_account.Credentials` credentials using a service account key to obtain an access token.\n- `google.auth.jwt.Credentials` credentials using a service account key to directly assert credentials.\n- `google.auth.gae.Credentials` credentials using App Engine identity credentials.\n- `google.auth.gce.Credentials` credentials using the Compute Engine metadata server.\n- `google.auth.access_token.Credentials` credential using a bare access token.\n\nThis package won't contain anything related to storage or end-user based credentials.\n\nThe `google.oauth2` package will contain the remainder of the current library and focus solely on oauth2 user-specific stuff, better organized:\n- `google.oauth2.flow` - generic flow that can be easily used with web frameworks.\n- `google.oauth2.credentials` - user credentials with access and refresh tokens.\n- `google.oauth2.storage` - a wrapper that allows credentials to be stored.\n  etc.\n\nWhat are you initial thoughts @nathanielmanistaatgoogle @dhermes @waprin @thobrla @anthmgoogle @elibixby @pferate  & any others.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/oauth2client/issues/597/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/oauth2client/issues/466", "title": "contrib.appengine.OAuth2Decorator._in_error is unused.", "body": "", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/oauth2client/issues/466/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/oauth2client/issues/463", "title": "oauth2client.tools should not fail silently without argparse", "body": "Presently, tools has an import guard against argparse [here](https://github.com/google/oauth2client/blob/master/oauth2client/tools.py#L56) because argparse is optional in py2.6.

I just went through my diffs and it looks like the only interface changes were dealing with crypto, which were just passing the results to and from the other libraries.  In some of the tests (jwt and service_accounts), I had to change the messages and signatures from str to bytes.  Since bytes is just an alias for str in Python2.6+, this only really matters in Python3.\n\nAlso, I wasn't completely sure the proper way to handle the mox library used in the tests.  It looks like the last official release was from Aug. 2010 and was never migrated from Google Code to GitHub with the rest of Google's projects.  There is an unofficial port, mox3, which has been updated recently as a drop-in replacement.

The approach here could solve that problem as well, if the default behavior were `overwrite=True`. It's not clear to me how to specify that option, since the public interface for writing to the Storage object is `put` and that doesn't pass along any additional args into `locked_put`. I could certainly subclass django_orm.Storage and override its put method but that's not ideal. What I really want is overwrite to be the default behavior. Revisiting earlier discussion in this PR, could we eliminate the overwrite parameter entirely and make it the default?\n\nOn another note, the diff mentioned in that issue (https://code.google.com/r/johnscottatlakson-google-api-python-client/source/diff?spec=svna0321a5135af2f9005646e9313ff844120b1ef01&r=a0321a5135af2f9005646e9313ff844120b1ef01&format=side&path=/oauth2client/django_orm.py) does two interesting things I wanted to mention:\n- Uses Django's `select_for_update` to ensure atomic updates for models that have a CredentialsField. Ostensibly this is to prevent race conditions when multiple application servers update the same model after its access_token has expired. However, I don't think `select_for_update` prevents this behavior -- the last save will still win.\n- Preserves any existing `refresh_token` stored in the old Credentials object if the new object doesn't have one. This is an optimization and isn't necessary, but could be useful in some cases since Google only allows 25 refresh tokens to exist at a time for a given client/user combination.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/oauth2client/issues/comments/46478931/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "jeffposnick": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/oauth2client/issues/comments/47267084", "body": "LGTM.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/oauth2client/issues/comments/47267084/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/oauth2client/issues/comments/47267103", "body": "LGTM.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/oauth2client/issues/comments/47267103/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "whirlycott": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/oauth2client/issues/comments/48557134", "body": "Googler here.
