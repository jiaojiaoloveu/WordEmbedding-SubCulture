As I mentioned in the code review:\n\nIt was the simplest fix I could think of, though it is probably not the best - the height is fixed instead of being dynamic and using only \nthe required space.\n\nThe fixed value was chosen with 800x600 resolutions in mind. At this resolution the text above the graph occupies four lines instead of \ntwo, and that has to be accounted for. This leaves a blank space below the graph at bigger resolutions, and bigger font sizes are not \nproperly supported (because the height is fixed).\n\nThat said, and given the purpose of this tool, I do think that having this fix is better than leaving the schedule viewer as it is. If someone \nmore knowledgeable of web development knows how to fix it properly or if there's time in the future then this can be revisited then.\n\n**Status:** New  \n**Owner:** ---  \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997526/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997527", "body": "_From [joe.hugh...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/105329591737206182947/) on March 26, 2008 21:38:34_\n\nFixed as of r648\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997527/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997534", "body": "_From [tom.brow...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/102106286505569161652/) on September 17, 2009 21:05:20_\n\n(No comment was entered for this change.)\n\n**Status:** New  \n**Owner:** ---  \n**Labels:** -Priority-Medium Priority-Low  \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997534/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997539", "body": "_From [wrl...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/112599231040201259540/) on May 03, 2009 14:10:41_\n\nHasn't this been implemented in the released versions for a long time?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997539/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997540", "body": "_From [tom.brow...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/102106286505569161652/) on September 17, 2009 21:21:15_\n\nstop_code is read but not validated in any way.\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997540/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997553", "body": "_From [tom.brow...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/102106286505569161652/) on September 17, 2009 21:22:03_\n\n(No comment was entered for this change.)\n\n**Status:** New  \n**Owner:** ---  \n**Labels:** Difficulty-Moderate  \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997553/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997558", "body": "_From [clancy.c...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/115744260030380666284/) on November 06, 2008 14:29:22_\n\nIs this the same as checking that no time-travel occurs on a trip? i.e. where a\nstop_time of sequence 10 departing at 02:35:40 and a sequence of 11 arriving at\n02:31:50 should be flagged as wrong?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997558/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/transitfeed/issues/comments/56997559", "body": "_From [tom.brow...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/102106286505569161652/) on November 06, 2008 14:37:32_\n\nThis bug is about catching a corner case.
