This is driving me crazy!\n\nThe original source file is still available to download from this link:\nhttp://living.tv/mob/ibeani_i4.mp4\n(this version is AACHE+1 i.e. SBR)\n\nMy latest attempt to get it to play is available under this mpd file:\nhttp://living.tv/mob/test_800k.mpd\n(This file was actually created when I was trying to get an AACHE+2 file version to work instead)\n(you can put this directly into the DASH_IF reference player: http://dashif.org/reference/players/javascript/1.3.0/samples/dash-if-reference-player/index.html )\n\nI have been trying AAC, AACHE+1, AACHE+2 alternatives of the original, and I always get this timing problem, playback is finishing with 1.5 seconds of the video and audio streams showing as buffered.\n\nNor does the mpd file validate on: http://dashif.org/conformance.html\n(the validator just continues to run forever, and never completes the test)\n\nThese were my latest steps:\n\nMP4Box -raw 1 ibeani_i4.mp4\nMP4Box -raw 2 ibeani_i4.mp4\nMP4Box -add ibeani_i4_track1.h264 -fps 25 ibeani_i4_video.m4v\nMP4Box -add ibeani_i4_track2.aac ibeani_i4_audio.m4a\nMP4Box -dash 4000 -frag 4000 -rap -frag-rap -profile dashavc264:live -segment-name %%s -url-template -out \"test_800k.mpd\" ibeani_i4_video.m4v ibeani_i4_audio.m4a\n\nAnyway, I thought if you had the original source file (link above), that you (or anyone else) might be able to get a working solution, or else isolate the problem...\n\nFrustrated!\n\nRichard\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/83732533/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/83772644", "body": "p.s.

The content you provided is ok. But it ends up with a shorter segment. @Duration https://github.com/Duration 's definition in the DASH spec:\n\nIf present, specifies the constant approximate Segment duration.\n\nAll Segments within this Representation element have the same duration unless it is the last Segment within the Period, which could be significantly shorter.\n\nThe value of the duration in seconds is the division of the value of this attribute and the value of the @timescale attribute associated to the containing Representation.\n\nSo I don't see anything wrong in what we do.\n\n@jeanlf https://github.com/jeanlf  We could ignore the last segment duration, what do you think? (I thought we did actually)\n\n@richardbushell https://github.com/richardbushell  You can prepare your content so that you end up with same duration segments (e.g. MP4Box -splitx 0:48 ibeani_i4_mcqtlow.mp4). You could also report a bug to dash.js so that they don't rely too strictly on this 'approximative' duration for the playback.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/62#issuecomment-84961449 .  https://github.com/notifications/beacon/AK40imA580ElWhHrUGxvConSS7TU3TDIks5n3_NugaJpZM4Dsty1.gif \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/84965566/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/85009371", "body": "Hi Jean,\n\nI have just downloaded and tried: gpac-0.5.2-DEV-rev163-ge23a154-master-x64.exe\n\nDoes this include the latest commit/changes?\n\nIt still reports the original segment duration error.\n\nRichard\n\nFrom: jeanlf [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nSent: 23 March 2015 12:41\nTo: gpac/gpac\nCc: richardbushell\nSubject: Re: [gpac] mp4box bug when creating DASH files containing aacplus/sbr audio (#62)\n\nCould you give a try at the last commit ( https://github.com/gpac/gpac/commit/0c0efac10ce926a16ff9719085ff27fabddcb930 0c0efac) ?\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/62#issuecomment-84977047 .  https://github.com/notifications/beacon/AK40ikwWgUIPHUGZgDaYHP6jssmT2IAdks5n4AFxgaJpZM4Dsty1.gif \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/85009371/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/85067833", "body": "OK, thanks for letting us know.

Till now, access to streaming these files has been restricted to a trusted network, so I could keep the links (MPD, m4s segments etc.) on my storage bucket public. However, I now have a requirement to open streaming access on a public network. As such, I wanted to experiment with making these links private and editing the MPD programmatically to contain secure signed URLs for each segment like so -\r\n\r\n`<SegmentURL media=\"<signed url to an m4s file>\"/>`\r\n\r\nWill manually editing thusly generate a valid MPD? Is this a good approach to ensure secure links to the video files for streaming? Or should I instead figure out an approach using encryption / DRM supported by MP$Box?

We are indicating the discontinuity of resolution by inserting a new period in MPD. Further, we are using -dash-ctx option and multiple MP4Box commands to achieve this. Please find the 4 commands below that we used to package 4 different MP4 files of 10 seconds each.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCommand1: MP4Box -quiet -dash-strict 10000 -rap -dash-scale 1000 -tfdt 0 -moof-sn 0 -subsegs-per-sidx -1 -mpd-title \"dash-chunked-transcode\" -dash-ctx ctx.txt -mpd-info-url abc.com -segment-name test_0 input_480_270_1159kbps.mp4:period=0:id=0 -out manifest.mpd\r\nCommand2: MP4Box -quiet -dash-strict 10000 -rap -dash-scale 1000 -tfdt 10000 -subsegs-per-sidx -1 -mpd-title \"dash-chunked-transcode\" -dash-ctx ctx.txt -mpd-info-url abc.com -segment-name test_0 input_480_270_1133kbps.mp4:period=0:id=0 -out manifest.mpd\r\nCommand3: MP4Box -quiet -dash-strict 10000 -rap -dash-scale 1000 -tfdt 20000 -moof-sn 2 -subsegs-per-sidx -1 -mpd-title \"dash-chunked-transcode\" -dash-ctx ctx.txt -mpd-info-url abc.com -segment-name test_1 input_768_432_785kbps.mp4:period=1:id=0 -out manifest.mpd\r\nCommand4: MP4Box -quiet -dash-strict 10000 -rap -dash-scale 1000 -tfdt 30000 -subsegs-per-sidx -1 -mpd-title \"dash-chunked-transcode\" -dash-ctx ctx.txt -mpd-info-url abc.com -segment-name test_1 input_768_432_783kbps.mp4:period=1:id=0 -out manifest.mpd\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note the manifest file at the end of each command with GPAC version 0.7.1:\r\nSame is present at [Observations_GPACv0.7.1.zip](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/files/1292113/Observations_GPACv0.7.1.zip)\r\n\r\nNote the SegmentList within manifest file post Command3 (complete manifest file is present in the directory Command3_Segment11). \r\n```\r\n<Period id=\"0\" duration=\"PT0H0M20.000S\">\r\n\t<SegmentList timescale=\"12800\" duration=\"128000\">\r\n\t\t<Initialization sourceURL=\"test_0init.mp4\"/>\r\n\t\t<SegmentURL media=\"test_01.m4s\"/>\r\n\t\t<SegmentURL media=\"test_02.m4s\"/>\r\n\t</SegmentList>\r\n</Period>\r\n<Period id=\"1\" duration=\"PT0H0M10.000S\">\r\n\t<SegmentList timescale=\"12800\" duration=\"128000\">\r\n\t\t<Initialization sourceURL=\"test_1init.mp4\"/>\r\n\t\t<SegmentURL media=\"test_01.m4s\"/>\r\n\t\t<SegmentURL media=\"test_02.m4s\"/>\r\n\t\t<SegmentURL media=\"test_11.m4s\"/>\r\n\t</SegmentList>\r\n</Period>\r\n```\r\nMy question is that, why does period 1 has 3 segments? I expected it to have only test_11.m4s. Looks like GPAC maintains this list of segment internally and doesn't clear when new period starts.\r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\n1. How I obtained GPAC: \r\nDownloaded using the command: wget https://github.com/gpac/gpac/archive/v0.7.1.tar.gz\r\nBuilt the same post that.\r\n\r\n2. Operating System: CentOS Linux release 7.1 64 bit\r\n\r\n3. Application used: MP4Box\r\n\r\n4. GPAC version: \r\nMP4Box - GPAC version 0.7.1-revrelease\r\n\r\nFurther, I tried executing the four commands with the latest nightly build of GPAC. (GPAC version 0.7.2-DEV-revUNKNOWN_REV). Behaviour with this version is little different. \r\nNote the SegmentList within manifest file post Command3 (complete manifest file is present in the directory Command3_Segment11 inside \r\n[Observations_GPACv0.7.2-DEV.zip](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/files/1292247/Observations_GPACv0.7.2-DEV.zip)\r\n).\r\n```\r\n<Period id=\"0\" duration=\"PT0H0M10.000S\">\r\n\t<SegmentList timescale=\"12800\" duration=\"128000\">\r\n\t\t<Initialization sourceURL=\"test_0init.mp4\"/>\r\n\t\t<SegmentURL media=\"test_01.m4s\"/>\r\n\t\t<SegmentURL media=\"test_01.m4s\"/>\r\n\t</SegmentList>\r\n</Period>\r\n<Period id=\"1\" start=\"PT0H0M10.000S\" duration=\"PT0H0M10.000S\">\r\n\t<SegmentList timescale=\"12800\" duration=\"128000\">\r\n\t\t<Initialization sourceURL=\"test_1init.mp4\"/>\r\n\t\t<SegmentURL media=\"test_01.m4s\"/>\r\n\t\t<SegmentURL media=\"test_11.m4s\"/>\r\n\t</AdaptationSet>\r\n</Period>\r\n```\r\nI expected it to have only test_11.m4s in period 1, but it has both test_01.m4s and test_11.m4s. Which looks wrong.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAnita\r\n\r\n- [x] I looked for a similar issue and couldn't find any.\r\n- [x] I tried with the latest version of GPAC.

I can share files anonymously with dropbox (see links provided below). \r\n\r\nHello, \r\n\r\nI have a 8-minute 360 video that is divided into 5x5 tiles. The video was prepared using the latest version of kvazaar. 2 representations are prepared - 500kbps and 5Mbps. \r\n\r\nIt is then converted into DASH format using the latest version of MP4Box with the following command: \r\n\r\n`MP4Box -dash 2000 -profile live -out ba.mpd -segment-name segment/%s 500k.mp4 5M.mp4`\r\n\r\nThe whole video set (including MPD file and all segments) can be downloaded at: \r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/hvflbdx442r5y2g/blue-angel.tar.gz?dl=0\r\n\r\nI'm streaming the video in a local network setup as follows: \r\n\r\n[Server] <-> [Network Impairment Node] <-> [Client]\r\n\r\nwhere the network impairment node is able to add delays and packet loss to the path (using standard Linux tc netem). \r\n\r\nWhile MP4Client can play the video without any problem, I notice that no matter how poor the network is, MP4Client always chooses the 5Mbps representation and does not switch to a lower quality. This causes the video playback to stall every 2 seconds. \r\n\r\nLooking into the log file (using MP4Client's dash@debug option), which can be downloaded at https://www.dropbox.com/s/39w79kkjfzoixw8/mp4client-400ms.log?dl=0\r\n\r\nI can see the following output: \r\n\r\n`[DASH] Rate Adaptation - download rate 11872 kbps - 3 quality levels (cumulated representations rate 5045 kbps)`\r\n\r\nwhile the actual download throughput is less than 1Mbps, which is observed by running Wireshark on the client machine. \r\n\r\nIt's important to note that this issue seems to apply to SRD tiled video only. When I play non-tiled video using the same setup, MP4Client is able to correctly adapt representations based on network condition. \r\n\r\nThanks! \r\nChang", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/827/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "Prividen": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/826", "title": "Strange result when -cat files with :dur= option (missing reference)", "body": "If I try to -cat mp4 files, it works fine:\r\n`$ MP4Box -new  -cat cam1-2017-04-03-00-03-45.mp4 good_file.mp4`\r\n`Appending file cam1-2017-04-03-00-03-45.mp4`\r\n`No suitable destination track found - creating new one (type vide)`\r\n`Saving good_file.mp4: 0.500 secs Interleaving`\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if i try to -cat files with :dur option, it produce broken result:\r\n\r\n`$ MP4Box -new  -cat cam1-2017-04-03-00-03-45.mp4:dur=60 broken_file.mp4`\r\n`IsoMedia import cam1-2017-04-03-00-03-45.mp4 - track ID 1 - Video (size 1920 x 1080)`\r\n`Appending file cam1-2017-04-03-00-03-45.mp4:dur=60)`\r\n`No suitable destination track found - creating new one (type vide)`\r\n`Saving broken_file.mp4: 0.500 secs Interleaving`\r\n\r\nwhen i try to rewind such broken file in VLC, it show garbage image till next I-frame, and wrote to console:\r\n[h264 @ 0x7f6330cb4cc0] reference picture missing during reorder\r\n[h264 @ 0x7f6330cb4cc0] Missing reference picture\r\n\r\nAlso, avprobe -show_packets for good file show \"flags=K\" for I-frames and \"flags=_\" for other frames.\r\nFor broken files it show: \r\n- \"flags=_\" for all frames, if file was created by MP4Box v. 0.6.1\r\n- \"flags=K\" for all frames, if file was created by MP4Box v. 0.7.1\r\n\r\nNo any other difference between good and broken files in avprobe or mediainfo output (but normal file has a bit larger size).\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/826/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "rhazor": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/825", "title": "Installing gpac deleted all PATH variables", "body": "Very very nice.

MP4Box is observed when input mp4-file contains AVC/H.264 video with different SPS (i.e. some SPS in mdat-box differ from that specified in AVCc). \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue i uploaded a small video excerpt in format m4:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/34170boalfl1eo63mcmll5u5gnn5pat3\r\n\r\nThe nal layout in the mp4 file is correct and the file itself is compliant:\r\n\r\nNal        aud (9 ), refIdc 0, offset a0, size 2 (dec 2)\r\nNal        sps (7 ), refIdc 3, offset a6, size 22 (dec 34)\r\nNal        pps (8 ), refIdc 3, offset cc, size 4 (dec 4)\r\nNal        sei (6 ), refIdc 0, offset

command:\r\n\r\nMP4Box -raw 1 bigbang.mp4 -out es.h264\r\n\r\nFor the very first video frame the access unit delimiter (AUD) is not the first NAL as required by the standard. The nal layout in the extracted stream:\r\n\r\nFrame #0\r\nnal 7 (sps)\r\nnal 8 (pps)\r\nnal 9 (aud)\r\nnal 7 (sps)\r\nnal 8 (pps)\r\nnal 6 (sei)\r\nnal 6 (sei)\r\nnal 6 (sei)\r\nnal 5 (idr)\r\n\r\nFrame #1\r\nnal 9 (aud)\r\nnal 6 (sei)\r\nnal 6 (sei)\r\nnal 1 (pb-frame)\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nSo, MP4Box misplaces AUD for the first frame, AUD must be the first  NAL. \r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/812/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "rosipov": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/808", "title": "Generating an MPD manifest from a fMP4 w/o generating segments ", "body": "I'm running the following command on a fragmented MP4 in an attempt to generate a DASH MPD manifest file that references the input files: \r\n`MP4Box -dash 1000 -profile dashavc264:onDemand -out food_review.mpd food_review_low.mp4 food_review_med.mp4 food_review_high.mp4`\r\n\r\nInstead I am getting three segmentation files (\"food_review_low_dashinit.mp4\", etc) generated for each input video which the mpd manifest file references. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to use MP4Box in order to generate an MPD file that references the fragmented mp4 videos rather than creating seperate segments? \r\n\r\n- \u2705 I looked for a similar issue and couldn't find any.\r\n- \u2705 I tried with the latest version of GPAC.

Subtitle content that falls entirely\noutside the duration of the sample shall be omitted [...]\nAny timed content that falls partially outside of the sample boundaries may be used for error\nrecovery\n```\n\nSo IMHO EBU Tech3381 neither recommends nor invalidates the use of 'sample_has_redundancy'.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/78254260/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/78445846", "body": "An idea would be to run Valgrind with `--tool=helgrind`.

These are not even IOP profiles :)\n\nYes, they are. DASH-IF sponsored and validated the work, and asked for that option names. See http://www.gpac-licensing.com/2014/08/21/ibc-2014-dash-avc264-support-in-gpac/\n\nAt that time things were not as clear as they were today. As you mention the 'IOP' term wasn't used. DASH-IF people told us to only consider the v2 document.\n\nNow if you look at table 1 in any DASH-IF updated IOP document, you'll find the map between the old profile names and the new ones. v2 would be now associated with the identifier \"http://dashif.org/guidelines/dash264#hd\". But it makes no sense to make a one-to-one mapping for non HD content for example... and content could be attached to several profiles at the same time ; that's why we introduced the '-profile-ext' MP4Box option (`-profile-ext STRING  specifies a list of profile extensions, as used by DASH-IF and DVB.`) and make no further checks.\n\nIt now seems to me that v2.0 superseeds the v1.0. I am unsure about the relationship between v3 and v2... but since the profiles are redundant (when I read the 'Introduction' of both documents' profiles) I would also say v2 is superseeded by v3. \n\nThe names I changed for the enums might not be optimal. I didn't finish the work and align the one you introduced ono a common notation. The names you initially proposed were redundant, probably because you didn't realize we implemented v2.0 of the profiles :) Enum names won't be the issue when we agree on how to proceed.\n\nAlso please note that what you reference are not the \"profiles\", they are the \"identifiers\" of the IOPs (a notion that was introduced in v3). We can already add any URN with the '-profile-ext' MP4Box option (`-profile-ext STRING  specifies a list of profile extensions, as used by DASH-IF and DVB.`).\n\nLooking at the DASH-IF spec, the only differences between the IOPs are on the content itself. That's why it made sense for me when I read your `if (is_dashif_profile(dasher->profile)) {` block.\n\nGPAC Licensing is member of the DASH-IF so we can easily ask questions if we have any doubt.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/comments/14756422/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/comments/14756502", "body": "Seems like http://dashif.org/identifiers/profiles/ is not up-to-date.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/comments/14756502/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/comments/16169280", "body": "@nguyen-viet-thanh-trung Does it mean that there may be more than stbl->nb_sgpd_in_stbl sampleGroupsDescriptions?

over at http://stackoverflow.com, my mp4box script is correct and this should be reported as a bug.\r\n**Stackoverflow forum thread:** http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42230812/segment-audio-video-and-create-mpd-with-mp4box\r\n\r\n### Bug-information\r\n\r\n- When running scrips below, the created .mpd file is not created correctly. The .mpd only uses one stream for all **\"AdaptationSets\"**. Look at downloadable files for result.\r\n- To re-create the issue, use the muxed **\"MULTIPLEX_DASH.mp4\"** as source and run command below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### MP4BOX - Script\r\n\r\n```\r\nMP4Box -dash 4000\r\n       -profile dashavc264:onDemand\r\n       -bs-switching no\r\n       -url-template\r\n       -mpd-title multivideo_vod_mpd\r\n           MULTIPLEX_DASH.mp4:trackID=1:id=v0:role=v0\r\n           MULTIPLEX_DASH.mp4:trackID=2:id=v1:role=v1\r\n           MULTIPLEX_DASH.mp4:trackID=3:id=v2:role=v2\r\n           MULTIPLEX_DASH.mp4:trackID=4:id=v3:role=v3\r\n           MULTIPLEX_DASH.mp4:trackID=5:id=v4:role=v4\r\n           MULTIPLEX_DASH.mp4:trackID=6:id=v5:role=v5\r\n           MULTIPLEX_DASH.mp4:trackID=7:id=v6:role=v6\r\n           MULTIPLEX_DASH.mp4:trackID=8:id=v7:role=v7\r\n           MULTIPLEX_DASH.mp4:trackID=9:id=a0\r\n           MULTIPLEX_DASH.mp4:trackID=10:id=a1\r\n           MULTIPLEX_DASH.mp4:trackID=11:id=a2\r\n       -out OHD_25_multivideo.mpd\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/756/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "xixi10111011": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/755", "title": "MP4Client failed to playback hevc-tiled dash contents", "body": "I installed GPAC by using nightly builds http://gpac.io/downloads/gpac-nightly-builds/\r\nhttp://download.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/gpac/latest_builds/linux64/gpac/gpac_0.6.2-DEV-rev1395-g8d096e5-master_amd64.deb\r\n\r\n\r\nMP4Client -gui http://download.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/gpac/SRD/srd_hevc/multi_rate/hevc_srd.mpd#LIVE360\r\n\r\nMP4Client failed to playback hevc-tiled dash contents\r\nlog shows:\r\n[Codec] ODM1 ES1: Cannot find decoder for stream type MPEG-H HEVC Video\r\nDeleting terminal... done (in 166 ms) - ran for 8887 ms\r\nGPAC cleanup .\r\n\r\n\r\nplease help, thanks", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/755/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "martinmelo00": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/752", "title": "DashCast dropping video frames and does not create output", "body": "Thanks for reporting your issue.

The problem is that browser (Chrome, FF, Edge) do not raise 'encrypted' event  and start to play encrypted data (random green squares appear).\r\nAccording to this spec:\r\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-encrypted-media-20140828/cenc-format.html#detect-encrypt\r\n Browser should detect encrypted content and raise the event but it does not. \r\nSo my question -

I have noticed that GPAC pads the incomplete block and still applies the AES-128-CTR encryption on the padded block. The padding of the encrypted block is then removed, and the partial encrypted block stored at the end of the subsample pattern.\n\nI was wondering if this is correct according standard (Common Encryption, ISO/IEC 23001-7, 3rd edition, June 2015). In fact, according standard (section 10.3), \"The BytesOfProtectedData size SHALL be a multiple of 16 bytes to avoid partial cipher blocks in Subsamples\". So, that case should in fact not happen and GPAC should not have generated a SENC box with non-block aligned clear/protected sections in a subsample.\n\nStill in case it happens, section 9.6.1 says: \"If the last Block pattern in a Subsample is incomplete, the partial pattern SHALL be followed until truncated by the BytesOfProtectedData size, and any partial crypt_byte_block SHALL remain unencrypted.\"\n\nDo you care to comment on that point?\n\nThanks in advance and best regards,\n\nThierry Bertschi\nNagravision S.A.\n\nThanks for reporting your issue.

Therefore I'm pretty sure there is an issue in the native code because that code has been changed in the meantime..\n\nEDIT:\nindeed the problem starts in the **Preview.java** file where the camera data is sent to the native code\n**processFrameBuf(data)**\nIn the **droid_cam.c** there is the function managing the data (**Java_com_gpac_Osmo4_Preview_processFrameBuf**). In the old version of **droid_cam.c** that I have the data was handled by **gf_term_on_sl_packet()**. Now I see that the function has been changed to **gf_service_send_packet()**. I think the problem comes from there but I really cannot follow where the camera data goes and how it is actually displayed on the screen!\n\nEDIT2:\nThe data coming from the camera is correct. I saved an image and it looks ok, even if it's rotated with 90deg. This is another reason to believe that there's an issue in the native code and not in the android app.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/88852531/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/comments/19329642", "body": "Quick remark: in hybrid mode the animations (translations,  rotations of 2D/3D elements in a BIFS scene) are slow (laggy).

Let's assume that you want to fragment this file with 30 sec fragments. In MP4Box, we will create two samples: Sample 1 (CTS=0, dur=30s) and Sample 2 (CTS=30s, dur=30s) with exactly the same content. From a player perspective, when you play the second sample, you may be interested in knowing that the 2nd sample content is exactly the same as the previous one, so that you don't reload a new document (restarting animations with possible gaps ...). The redundant flag says:\nFor streams that are not audio,video, a sample that is RAP and that has \"sample_has_redundancy=1 can be discarded, and its duration added to the duration of the preceding one, to maintain the timing of subsequent samples.\"\n\nI hope that clarifies that part.

This phase is media-aware, meaning that we can look into the media data to determine things like how many tracks are needed, how many samples, what the timestamps are. \n\nThe second phase is _dashing_ (fragmenting and segmenting). This phase is media-unaware, meaning that we don't look/touch at the sample content to create fragments or segments.

To make sure, consider the following example: a TTML file corresponds to an entire 1-hour long movie, with many paragraphs. \n\nOne approach to store it into an MP4 file is to create only one sample out of this document. Now, assuming that you want segments of 1 min, since we don't want to modify the sample content (see previous answer), we have no choice but create 60 samples, all with the same content, but with different sample times. That's simple, but not very efficient from a storage point of view. From a player's perspective, the player has to load many identical large documents (or use the redundant signaling).  \n\nThe other approach is to create many samples during import to enable more compact storage and better dashing. From a player's perspective, it has to load many small documents. The difficulty here is how many samples to create. \n\nMP4Box supports both approaches:\n- you can create samples directly without having MP4Box look at or alter the TTML content, using NHML. See http://concolato.wp.mines-telecom.fr/2014/01/27/first-attempt-at-storing-ttml-in-mp4/. That approach can be used by TTML authors who made sure that their TTML documents are ready for DASHing (i.e. have the right duration). We could probably improve the usability of this approach when there is only one TTML document to import (merge with the approach below).\n- you can let MP4Box create the samples for you as documented in http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/2014/08/23/ebu-ttd-support-in-gpac/. That second option is probably too strict as it tries to create as many samples as possible and fails if paragraphs overlap (we thought initially that EBU-TT-D forbade that). I'm thinking of adding a parameter to add a target sample duration so that fewer samples would be created.\n\nHTH,\nCyril\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/78459114/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/84087327", "body": "@nigelmegitt I think we're in agreement.

My view so far has been that the process of extracting relevant parts of the initial document, without otherwise modifying them, and using them to synthesise new smaller documents is not a change to the content in itself, but is in fact the process for creating time-restricted samples of TTML.\n\nAs you said, we come from different perspectives and don't have always the same vocabulary. For me \"creating time-restricted samples of TTML\" indeed means changing the TTML content, because it's unclear that the extraction of the TTML content from the resulting MP4 samples in that case can result in the same input TTML documents. \n\n> It'd be bad for data rates and processing if implementations kept on fetching the same data and reprocessing it though!\n\nSure! One has to be careful when using this flag. In my mind, it should only be used at segment boundaries when the duplication of the sample cannot be avoided.\n\n> Okay, this is something I need to look into more - I thought this wasn't a problem. Is it a practical issue rather than a theoretical one? What are the attributes of the live cases that make them susceptible to this?\n\nIt's a complex problem, maybe a bit pathological. You can look at the latest [DASH Defect under Investigation](http://wg11.sc29.org/doc_end_user/documents/111_Geneva/wg11/w15213.zip) where it talks a little bit about that. The problem is that since the MPD announces in advance the segment names, if those are based on a constant duration, the segment duration has to be quite constant to avoid drift and fetching the wrong segment or getting 404. \n\n> This could mean a couple of things, so can I unpack what you mean? By \"multiplexed representations\" are you talking about Representations containing multiple Sub-Representations, one of which contains the subtitle media content component? Or do you mean Representations that contain MPEG-2 transport stream Media Segments that contain multiplexed content? I don't think anyone has defined the carriage of TTML in MPEG-2 TS yet, so it'd be good if we can rule that out for the time being.\n> \n> Assuming you mean the first one, yes, I can see that the segment boundaries are the same for all the Sub-Representations present.\n\nBy \"multiplexed representation\", I meant a representation for which media segments contain multiple media content components: eg Audio+Video+Subtitle. This does not necessarily mean using SubRepresentations. I did not mean MPEG-2 TS (although indeed that's a typical use case), but ISOBMFF. Arguably, that's not very common though.\n\n> It's actually pretty easy (computationally, and in code) to pull out the TTML content that overlaps any given defined time period from a single document covering a longer period. I've seen an XSLT that can do it, for example. It's even simpler in EBU-TT-D than generic TTML because some of the time calculation complexities are reduced. MP4Box seems to have code to do this already.\n> \n> But yes, doing no processing is always easier than doing some processing!\n> \n> Since some packagers will create temporal samples from the TTML, and it's allowed in the specs, it follows that all receiver implementations need to be able to handle it. I think that's the macro point here. I'm very happy with any assistance that can be provided in packaging and any optimisations in implementations to help provide the right user experience.\n\nAs @rbouqueau said, the problem is not the difficulty/complexity of doing it. The problem is when to do it. When preparing the MP4 file, it's fine. When DASHing that's problematic. DASH processing (creating segments, MPD ...) should not require having to change the number and content of media samples (in your terms \"pull out the TTML, apply XSLT, ...\"). In terms of software architecture and layering, that would require some communication between the \"compression\"/media-aware layer and the DASH/media-unaware layer during DASHing. So far, we haven't had the need for that and we should avoid it.  \n\n> We maybe were coming from two different starting points: I thought we were talking about a model where TTML samples matching the segment period were being extracted from the source TTML; I now see that you weren't saying that. In the model I had in mind, my point was simply that there is no and can be no fixed relationship between the begin and end times in the original (pre-sampling) TTML and the segment times, meaning that some TTML content will end up being reproduced in adjacent samples some of the time.\n\nI fully agree with \"there is no and can be no fixed relationship between the begin and end times in the original (pre-sampling) TTML and the segment times\". In MP4Box model, a first phase is to create \"samples\" from the original TTML content. A second phase is to create segments from the samples, without touching the TTML content anymore. So the first phase has to prepare the second phase appropriately. That's where we can improve MP4Box as we currently import either unmodified TTML documents as separate samples (using NHML) or we create many samples from a given TTML document (probably too many and that fails in case of overlap).\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/84585647/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/85053204", "body": "Our Windows buildbot has some problems at the moment. rev165 should include the fix.

Each are produced using the normal profile with the extra settings of web optomised and fast deinterlace. Each of these files, on their own, work flawlessly in a number of media players. On occasion I want to concetenate two or more of these files together to produce a single file. After some experimentation I've been doing this using MP4Box with the following command line (Note that usually the -force-cat option isn't really needed and it appears to make no difference to the following anyway):\n\n```\nMP4Box -force-cat -cat part1.m4v part2.m4v -new merged.m4v\n```\n\nWhen I then open the merged file I find that the length of the video is longer than the sum of the two parts. The exact extra duration seems to vary and I haven't yet spotted any obvious patterns. This happens with every set of files I've tried that have a chapter track. The result is that the video plays normally but ends before it's reached the stated duration, but at the point you would expect if you simply add the lengths of the two parts together. It also means that if you seak past the actual end some players get rather upset!\n\nAs an example here is the output from -info for two input files\n\n\\* Movie Info *\n    Timescale 1000 - 3 tracks\n    Computed Duration 01:41:18.840 -

The chapter track is shown as having an \"indicated duration\" of 03:19:57 but a \"track duration\" of 03:46:33 which is approximately 8 minutes longer than it should be. When this file is played the length is reported as 3 hours and 46 minutes, but if you try and watch or seek past 03:38:48 it causes the player to stop, which makes sense as there is no audio or video data.\n\nMy feeling is that there is  a bug somewhere in the concatenation of the two chapter tracks causing the duration to be wrongly reported.\n\nI have figured out a work around which might allow you to shed some light on the issue. Once I have the merged file I extract the chapter information to a TTXT file using the command\n\n```\nMP4Box -ttxt 3 merged.m4v\n```\n\nThe resulting file looks fine and the last TextSample element has a sampleTime of 03:19:57.857 matching the indicated duration of the track.\n\nThe final stage is then to combine the audio and video from the merged file with this chapter track using the command\n\n```\nMP4Box -add merged.m4v#video -add merged.m4v#audio -add merged_3_text.ttxt:chap -new final.m4v\n```\n\nExtracting the info from this file gives\n\n\\* Movie Info *\n    Timescale 1000 - 3 tracks\n    Computed Duration 03:38:48.600 - Indicated Duration 03:38:48.600\n    Fragmented File: no\n    File suitable for progressive download (moov before mdat)\n    File Brand M4V  - version 1\n    Created: GMT Sun Jul 31 08:28:23 2016\n    Modified: GMT Sun Jul 31 08:28:23 2016\n\nFile has root IOD (9 bytes)\nScene PL 0xff - Graphics PL 0xff - OD PL 0xff\nVisual PL: ISO Reserved Profile (0x15)\nAudio PL: AAC Profile @ Level 2 (0x29)\nNo streams included in root OD\n\nTrack # 1 Info - TrackID 1 - TimeScale 90000\nMedia Duration 03:38:48.600 - Indicated Duration 03:38:48.600\nTrack has 3 edit lists: track duration is 03:38:48.600\nMedia Info: Language \"Undetermined (und)\" - Type \"vide:avc1\" - 328214 samples\nVisual Track layout: x=0 y=0 width=1015 height=424\nMPEG-4 Config: Visual Stream - ObjectTypeIndication 0x21\nAVC/H264 Video - Visual Size 714 x 424\n    AVC Info: 1 SPS - 1 PPS - Profile Main @ Level 4\n    NAL Unit length bits: 32\n    Pixel Aspect Ratio 64:45 - Indicated track size 1015 x 424\n    Chroma format YUV 4:2:0 - Luma bit depth 8 - chroma bit depth 8\n    SPS#1 hash: 3523075FCABC05AE3056F84F3CBDC8777E720AE8\n    PPS#1 hash: 8C412D9B36B16186B36C96A052D45F2432B0757F\nSelf-synchronized\n    RFC6381 Codec Parameters: avc1.4d4028\n    Average GOP length: 81 samples\n\nTrack # 2 Info - TrackID 2 - TimeScale 90000\nMedia Duration 03:38:48.504 - Indicated Duration 03:38:48.504\nTrack has 3 edit lists: track duration is 03:38:47.423\nMedia Info: Language \"English (eng)\" - Type \"soun:mp4a\" - 615350 samples\n1 UDTA types: name (1) \nMPEG-4 Config: Audio Stream - ObjectTypeIndication 0x40\nMPEG-4 Audio AAC LC - 2 Channel(s) - SampleRate 48000\nSynchronized on stream 1\n    RFC6381 Codec Parameters: mp4a.40.2\nAlternate Group ID 1\n    All samples are sync\n\nTrack # 3 Info - TrackID 3 - TimeScale 1000\nMedia Duration 03:38:48.600 - Indicated Duration 03:38:48.600\nTrack is disabled\nMedia Info: Language \"Undetermined (und)\" - Type \"text:tx3g\" - 48 samples\nUnknown Text Stream\n Size 0 x 0 - Translation X=0 Y=0 - Layer 0\n    RFC6381 Codec Parameters: tx3g\n    All samples are sync\n\nAs you can see the chapter track now has an indicated duration that matches the audio and video tracks and this file plays perfectly in the media players I've tried. The only differences I can see are that the chapter track no longer has an edit list and is reported as type text:tx3g instead of text:text as well as the TimeScale being 1000 instead of 90000, but I'm not sure if any of those would cause the issue.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/599/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "jcowgill": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/592", "title": "Support OpenJPEG 2", "body": "Debian bug: https://bugs.debian.org/826814\n\nOpenJPEG 1 is about to be removed from Debian so the OpenJPEG code in GPAC needs to be ported to OpenJPEG 2, or the JPEG2000 reader will have to be disabled in Debian (and probably other downstreams when they start removing OpenJPEG 1).\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/592/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "combucha": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/581", "title": "Timescales question", "body": "Hi\nI have raw .264 stream encoded at 30000/1001 fps.\nIf I mux it \"blindly\" without -fps option, mp4box sets up 120000/4004.\nIf I mux with -fps=29.97, mp4box sets up 30000/1001.\nBoth are the same and correct, but why mp4box just not divide values to the lowest possible?\nSimilar with 25fps (25000/1000 instead of just 25/1).\n\nOther timescale case, stream encoded at 2997/100 (round ntsc).\nMp4box sets up 11988/400 (as above 4 times higher).\nBut in this case I can't restore original 2997/100 timescale because fps=29.97 mp4box interprets as 30000/1001.\nIn this case It is impossible override framerate of ntsc_stream with framerate of rounded_ntsc_stream.

Now, playback on iOS has to go through a DASH to HLS transmux, which is ensured by [this library](https://github.com/google/universal-dash-transmuxer). But it seems the latter doesn't play well with 'saio' v1 box. A 'saio' v0 box that contains the same value for the offset works correctly. The location of it can remain exactly the same, just version of it is old which their transmuxer requires.\n\nObviously, I've first enquired about whether an udate of the transmuxer was planned, to accept v1 boxes.

That thread is here:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/gpac/discussion/287547/thread/6fa58849/\n\nThe issue that I am seeing, which is interestingly my only remaining issue with DashCast at this point ( aside from some a/v sync issues, if anyone needs assistance or an FAQ on DashCast I may be able to offer some help or guidance. ) is that with multiple video representations (various bitrates and outputs for  the dash segments), DashCast will begin encoding ONLY video segments very quickly (audio continues perfectly). However, upon further inspection of these video segments, one will note that they are not actually video segments, and though named correctly, contain no parseable MPEG-DASH data. \n\n**Assuming 8 second segments, the scenario where the issue prevents itself will look like this.**\n\n1) Segments are encoded about every ~7-8 seconds until some arbitrary segment number ( e.g `v1_seg_655.m4s, v2_seg_655.m4s, a1_seg_655.m4s`)\n2) Suddenly, every second or so, a new video segment will come out numbered after the previous and audio will continue encoding every ~7-8 seconds as expected. The new video segments will be corrupted and unusable. \n3) Another note is that CPU usage of DashCast will spike at this point, using 15-20x what the normal command would use.\n4) One can kill and restart the DashCast command and have it start from the beginning which will solve the issue until it occurs again in the next iteration. \n\n**MY INFORMATION**\nFFMPEG feeding DashCast cmd: `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg -analyzeduration 14M -i rtmp://localhost:1935/nginx-rtmp -loglevel panic -y -filter_complex [0:v]scale=1280:-1:lanczos[w1280_1] -map 0:a -c:a aac -ar 44100 -ac 2 -map [w1280_1] -f mpegts udp://127.0.0.1:1234?pkt_size=1316`\n\nDashCast cmd: `DashCast -av udp://127.0.0.1:1234?fifo_size=1000000 -live -seg-dur 8000 -conf /tmp/dashcast.conf -demux-buffer 500000 -mpd-refresh 8 -min-buffer 8.0 -gdr -npts -low-delay -out /media/ephemeral0/dash`\n\nDashCast config:\n[v1-600k]\ntype=video\nlow_delay=yes\nframerate=30\nheight=360\nwidth=640\ncodec=libx264\nbitrate=600000\ncrop_y=0\ncrop_x=0\n[v2-1200k]\ntype=video\nlow_delay=yes\nframerate=30\nheight=720\nwidth=1280\ncodec=libx264\nbitrate=1200000\ncrop_y=0\ncrop_x=0\n[v3-184k]\ntype=video\nlow_delay=yes\nframerate=30\nheight=360\nwidth=640\ncodec=libx264\nbitrate=184000\ncrop_y=0\ncrop_x=0\n[a1-64k]\nchannels=1\nbitrate=64000\nsamplerate=44100\ncodec=aac\ntype=audio\n[a2-128k]\nchannels=1\nbitrate=128000\nsamplerate=44100\ncodec=aac\ntype=audio\n\nFFMPEG Versioning information:\nffmpeg version N-78994-gbd2cc3c Copyright (c) 2000-2016 the FFmpeg developers\n  built with gcc 4.8 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.1)\n  configuration: --enable-shared --disable-debug --enable-libx264 --enable-avresample --enable-gpl\n  libavutil      55. 19.100 / 55. 19.100\n  libavcodec     57. 28.100 / 57. 28.100\n  libavformat    57. 28.100 / 57. 28.100\n  libavdevice    57.  0.101 / 57.  0.101\n  libavfilter     6. 39.102 /  6. 39.102\n  libavresample   3.  0.  0 /  3.  0.  0\n  libswscale      4.  0.100 /  4.  0.100\n  libswresample   2.  0.101 /  2.  0.101\n  libpostproc    54.  0.100 / 54.  0.100\n\n**MY THOUGHTS**\nI have a few thoughts on the issue that may help in coming to some sort of solution but are just thoughts I've had throughout this debacle.\n--I know that it is directly related to number of outputs. The more outputs there are, the faster DashCast will encounter this problem.\n--I know that when running other encoding(such as HLS or RTSP) on the same machine, DashCast will also encounter the problem faster.\n-Because of the above two points, the issue most certainly has something to do with CPU usage.\n-I also know that the issue prevents itself whether I use `-live-media` or just `-live`. Live seems to be the right choice for UDP input, but the response from `-live-media` is much more succinct and shows actual legible output when the issue happens which is : `[dashcast] Live system dropped a video frame` \n-Finally I fear that perhaps the container format `mpegts` from my `ffmpeg` command could be part of the problem as well. \nI reiterate that these are just my thoughts and don't necessarily have anything to do with the issue.\n\nThank you so much for taking a look at this and please let me know if there is anything else you need from me,\nCarter\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/493/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/461", "title": "Audio Segments will have weird rumbling noise if the input sampling rate is not 44100 Hz", "body": "There is a post here: https://sourceforge.net/p/gpac/bugs/349/ that is about this, but no open Github issues.

This generally works and ensures that the Dash Player will not look for segments that are so close to realtime that they have yet to be uploaded and registered by my CDN (S3 -> Cloudfront). \n\nHowever, though sometimes it plays perfectly and the mpd is correct, other times it will set the availabilityStartTime in the mpd to be this: `availabilityStartTime=\"1900-01-01T00:00:20.000Z\"`. Because of this, the player (dash.js) will look for enormous segment numbers and will not find them, causing the live video to be unplayable. \n\nIs there something that I am doing wrong in my command?

interestingly enough, if i dont tell it its live and do a straight command \n\n>  DashCast -av \"udp://236.44.100.1:5200?fifo_size=100000&buffer_size=500000\" -out output -mpd livetest.mpd \n\nIts happily chunking away, without complaining. I didnt try the playback, but the files do start getting created in the output folder. \n\nI didnt try this with the actual camera or screen capture source as this would be of no use to me, but i can certainly confirm that FFMPEG is happily demuxing the sources i am trying to use with DashCast\nhere is my FFMPEG build \n\n> ffmpeg version N-79345-g9149e9c Copyright (c) 2000-2016 the FFmpeg developers\n>   built with gcc 5.2.1 (Ubuntu 5.2.1-22ubuntu2) 20151010\n>   configuration: --enable-shared --disable-debug --enable-libx264 --enable-avresample --enable-gpl\n>   libavutil      55. 20.100 / 55. 20.100\n>   libavcodec     57. 34.100 / 57. 34.100\n>   libavformat    57. 33.100 / 57. 33.100\n>   libavdevice    57.  0.101 / 57.  0.101\n>   libavfilter     6. 41.100 /  6. 41.100\n>   libavresample   3.  0.  0 /  3.  0.  0\n>   libswscale      4.  1.100 /  4.  1.100\n>   libswresample   2.  0.101 /  2.  0.101\n>   libpostproc    54.  0.100 / 54.  0.100\n\nwould anyone be able to advise what could be causing this ? \n\nThanks\n\nSvyatko\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/487/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "HimanshuN": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/469", "title": "new segment not found error and live streaming using DashCast", "body": "can anyone please help me to achieve live streaming using DashCast. \nI am trying this command : \nDashCast -vf video4linux2 -v4l2f mjpeg -v /dev/video0 -af alsa -out output/ -npts \n\nwhich is creating segments, then on new terminal I am using \n\nMP4Client output/dashcast.mpd\n\nwhich is running successfully for sometime but then shows error of not finding new segments.\nThis error is because the MP4Client is searching segments at faster rates than DastCast creating it.

I encountered a problem, when extracting audio tracks from a *.mp4 container, that looks like a bug. I have an *.mp4 file that contains multiple audio tracks. The audio tracks are encoded using the ALAC codec. I want to extract those into seperate audio files using mp4box.\n\nWhat I've tryed so far for extracting a track is this:\n\n```\nmp4box -single 1 \"inputfile.mp4\" -out \"outputfile.m4a\"\n```\n\nWhat happens is, it works as that a `outputfile.m4a` is created, but something with the header/codec/file info seems to be malformated. I can open and play the file in VLC, but it fails to open with Windows Media Player/Windows Media Foundation (which I need). So either I am doing something wrong during the extraction or mp4box puts the file in a weird format.\n\nThe output of `mp4box -info -v \"outputfile.mp4\"` looks like this:\n\n```\n[iso file] Current top box start before parsing 0\n[iso file] Read Box type ftyp size 20 start 0\n[iso file] Current top box start before parsing 20\n[iso file] Read Box type mdat size 8555577 start 20\n[iso file] Current top box start before parsing 8555597\n[iso file] Read Box type free size 75 start 8555597\n[iso file] Current top box start before parsing 8555672\n[iso file] Read Box type moov size 4895 start 8555672\n[iso file] Read Box type mvhd size 108 start 8555680\n[iso file] Read Box type trak size 4779 start 8555788\n[iso file] Read Box type tkhd size 92 start 8555796\n[iso file] Read Box type mdia size 4679 start 8555888\n[iso file] Read Box type mdhd size 32 start 8555896\n[iso file] Read Box type hdlr size 55 start 8555928\n[iso file] Read Box type minf size 4584 start 8555983\n[iso file] Read Box type smhd size 16 start 8555991\n[iso file] Read Box type dinf size 36 start 8556007\n[iso file] Read Box type dref size 28 start 8556015\n[iso file] Read Box type url  size 12 start 8556031\n[iso file] Read Box type stbl size 4524 start 8556043\n[iso file] Read Box type stsd size 108 start 8556051\n[iso file] Read Box type alac size 92 start 8556067\n[iso file] Read Box type stts size 24 start 8556159\n[iso file] Read Box type stsc size 40 start 8556183\n[iso file] Read Box type stsz size 3936 start 8556223\n[iso file] Read Box type stco size 408 start 8560159\n[iso file] Read Box type alac size 36 start 28\n[iso file] Read Box type btrt size 20 start 64\n* Movie Info *\n        Timescale 600 - 1 track\n        Computed Duration 00:01:30.928 - Indicated Duration 00:01:30.928\n        Fragmented File: no\n        File Brand isom - version 1\n        Created: GMT Thu Dec 17 14:35:48 2015\n        Modified: GMT Thu Dec 17 14:35:48 2015\n\nFile has no MPEG4 IOD/OD\n\nTrack # 1 Info - TrackID 1 - TimeScale 44100\nMedia Duration 00:01:30.929 - Indicated Duration 00:01:30.929\nMedia Info: Language \"und (und)\" - Type \"soun:alac\" - 979 samples\nAudio Track - Sample Rate 44100 - 2 channel(s)\n[ISOM Tools] codec parameters not known - setting codecs string to default value \"alac\"\n        RFC6381 Codec Parameters: alac\n        All samples are sync\n```\n\nI also tryed extracting the audio tracks using the `-raw` flag like this:\n\n```\nmp4box -raw 1 \"inputfile.mp4\"\n```\n\nIt creates a `inputfile.mp4_track1.alac` file, which I can't open in any player (not even VLC). Looking at it in a HEX editor it looks like the raw data segment (which makes sense I guess), but I can't get mp4box to put it back into a .m4a which I can play.\n\nHere is a small python script to reproduce the above error:\n\n``` python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\ndef combineIntoOneMP4():\n    executionDir = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n    inputFile = os.path.join(executionDir, \"TechTalk_CC_music.m4a\")\n    outputFile = os.path.join(executionDir, \"testout.mp4\")\n\n    # main track not disabled\n    callArgs = [\"mp4box\", \"-add\", inputFile + \"#ID=Z\", outputFile]\n\n    for i in range(0, 4):\n        # other tracks disabled\n        callArgs.extend([\"-add\", inputFile + \"#ID=Z:disable\"])\n\n    #print(callArgs)\n    subprocess.check_call(callArgs)\n    print(\"Combined 5 tracks into one MP4 file: \" + os.path.basename(outputFile))\n\ndef extractAudioTracks():\n    executionDir = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n    inputFile = os.path.join(executionDir, \"testout.mp4\")\n\n    for i in range(0, 5):\n        outputFile = os.path.join(executionDir, \"extractedTrack_\" + str(i + 1) + \".m4a\")\n        callArgs = [\"mp4box\", \"-single\", str(i + 1), inputFile, \"-out\", outputFile]\n        #print(callArgs)\n        subprocess.check_call(callArgs)\n\n    print(\"Extracted tracks into seperate files.\")\n\n# call functions\ncombineIntoOneMP4()\nextractAudioTracks()\n```\n\nHere is a zip file containing the `TechTalk_CC_music.m4a` track that I used for testing and in the example: [Mp4Box Test.zip](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/files/68442/Mp4Box.Test.zip)\n\nSo I guess the question is am I doing anything wrong? Am I maybe missing some flag while extracting? Or is mp4box simply producing wrong results? I hope somebody can point me in the right direction.

It adds missing DASH-IF IOP profiles, as well as obsoletes the current, wrong ones. Using obsolete profiles will produce a warning.\n\nThe logic of using DASH-IF IOP profiles was also changed. Previously, using `dashavc264:live` was implicitly enabling `-url-template`, for example. But since `:live` and `:onDemand` parts are not included in the names of profiles anymore, users have to be more specific about what they want. For, example, in order to achieve the same behavior as in the previous example, the user must specify: `-profile \"dashif264\" -url-template`. For on-demand case, it will be something like this: `-profile \"dashif264\" -single-segment`.\n\nThis change is only about correct identifiers for different DASH-IF IOP profiles. Strictly speaking, each profile has its own restrictions, so, ideally, MP4Box would generate some warnings or errors if the user wants to do something that is restricted. I'm not sure that it's needed, though. First of all, it would complicate MP4Box, which is bad. And another reason is that perhaps it's a job of validators to check for compliance.\n\nAnyway, with this change, it's now possible to conform to different DASH-IF IOP profiles, using not only H.264/AVC, but H.265/HEVC as well.\n", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/69452700", "body": "@jeanlf, thanks for fixing it!\n\nBut I have some additional questions. -bs-switching by default is set to \"inband\". So, when I use multiple video streams that use the same codec, in MPD I see \"avc1.*\" values in Representation@codecs. But when I use multiple video streams that use different codecs, in MPD I see \"avc3.*\" values Representation@codecs. dash.js (1.2.0, and the latest from the development branch) in this case doesn't show the video (black screen), although the playback works and I hear the audio. I've tried to set -bs-switching to \"merge\". MP4Box reported \"[DASH]: Could not merge AVC|H264 SPS from different files (same SPS ID used) - disabling bitstream switching\", and in MPD, values in Representation@codecs are again set to \"avc1.*\", although the bitstream switching is turned off (this attribute is missing and by default it's set to \"false\", according to the DASH specification). But at the same time, this version works fine in dash.js. Well, actually, DASH-IF IOP v2.0 says in 4.2.2 (line 20): \"Clients are expected to support Inband Storage for SPS/PPS based ISO/IEC 14496-15, 20 Amendment 2 [22], i.e. sample entry 'avc3' and 'avc4'\". So, I assume that this is a bug in dash.js. But before reporting it, I'd like to better understand this topic.\n\nSo, my questions are:\n1. These avc modes (avc1, avc3, etc.). I don't know anything about them, and a quick search on this topic didn't give me any results. Could you recommend me some source of information where these modes are described? Or, perhaps, maybe you could explain it yourself? I'm not looking for low-level details. I just want to know enough in order to produce correct media.\n2. Since SPSs can't be merged, does it mean that it's better to avoid media that uses different codecs for different video Representations in the case when bitstream switching is needed? If so, then what are the problems (assuming that they exist) (including potential ones) for a media player to switch between such Representations?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/69452700/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/70399761", "body": "@jeanlf, thanks for clarification!

To refragment the result, use -dash option on the modified video, with the -tfdt N where N was the tfdt time of the edited segment (you can use -diso frag.m4s to find the tfdt).\n- when you have to distribute the result, concat (simple cat) the init segments and all the fragmented files.\n\nhope this helps\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/60232630/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/67347811", "body": "This should now be fixed, could you check it?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/67347811/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68846452", "body": "svn Rev 5577 now has -timescale to override movie timescale, and uses source movie timescale when no track is present in dest file.  \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68846452/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68870678", "body": "Indeed, now fixed on rev 5581\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68870678/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68871720", "body": "Indeed now fixed on SVN rev 5582, thanks for the report\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68871720/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68879264", "body": "The warning was not thrown correctly, this should now be fixed with rev 5583.\nThe merging of SPS only happens when using -bs-switching merge option, it's a special mode where SPSs from the different inputs are combined, when possible, in a single track description to allow for bitstream switching in 'avc1' mode rather than 'avc3' mode \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68879264/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68879346", "body": "Thanks for reporting, this is now fixed in rev 5583\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68879346/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68879502", "body": "Indeed, but this might take some time to fix as it implies a rearchitecture of the code ...\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68879502/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68988851", "body": "Indeed the isLeading flag was droped during import, now fixed in rev 5587. thanks for the report\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/68988851/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/69725994", "body": "1) (and same applies to HEVC): AVC and HEVC store codec config in SPS and PPS (and VPS for HEVC).

Peu de choses \u00e0 changer au niveau du code finalement, si ce n'est l'importance de mettre le fichier config in-app et (j'ai suppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque) d'avoir un r\u00e9f\u00e9rent in-app pour aller chercher le gui.bt.

From 00:00:15 to 00:00:20 sample n+1 _only_ would be active, so all the content that may overlap from sample n into sample n+1's period is irrelevant because that sample has been deactivated/dropped and doesn't generate any visible rendered output.\n\nA clever implementation might be able to spot that the Subtitle 1 `<p>`s are the same and make some optimisations on that basis: that's beyond what the specs say, but certainly permitted if it can be done reliably.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/78248075/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/78271907", "body": "@rbouqueau wrote:\n\n> Not correct. Let's remove the overlapping that is not supported in our EBU-TTD import. MP4Box will create 2 samples:\n\nIf your EBU-TT-D import doesn't support it then it has a problem: if you don't support arbitrary and constant (sample/)segment durations then you need a lookup table in the MPD to obtain the the URLs for fetching each sample/segment. This is particularly tricky for live cases. A constant duration model allows the client to construct the URLs - in that case you must expect overlapping content within adjacent samples.\n\nThere's no real need to have more than one sample per segment in the case of subtitles - all the samples are going to be in time order anyhow and the segment duration can be quite short. By creating lots of minimally sized samples based on the TTML timings in the content you're most likely to increase the data rate for no benefit.\n\n> Both samples n+1 and n+2 may be part of the same MPEG-DASH segment.\n\nBy the same token, they may be part of different segments.\n\n> So IMHO EBU Tech3381 neither recommends nor invalidates the use of 'sample_has_redundancy'.\n\nAgreed. But it isn't necessary to use `sample_has_redundancy`. IMHO it is a special case when adjacent samples do _not_ have some degree of overlap. I don't see the value in setting that attribute to true on most samples since it doesn't help player implementations, which aren't required to take any notice of it anyway, and it's not clear what they should do with the information because it's not specified anywhere.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/78271907/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/83500070", "body": "Sorry for the delay in responding.\n\n@rbouqueau I think of the set of times when something changes in the subtitles as being a separate and unrelated list to the set of segment or sample times. Note that a `<p>` in TTML is not necessarily the same as a subtitle, and multiple `<p>`s in the same document are permitted with exactly the same, or overlapping, or non-overlapping timings. As @cconcolato pointed out, EBU-TT-D does permit overlapping paragraphs.\n\n@cconcolato In your example of one sample for an hour long programme but segments of 1 minute, I wasn't aware that this is possible in DASH. Segments may contain one or more samples, right? Are you suggesting that the samples are duplicated across multiple segments? Or that the URL for the sample in each segment is in fact the same URL? I did not envisage that anyone would want to do that, and I don't see why they would - there's no reason not to create a single 1 hour segment for the subtitle Representation is there?\n\nWhen it comes to setting a redundant flag, I can see how your example would work @cconcolato but only if the sample content is identical. I got the impression before that @rbouqueau was thinking of setting it if some part of the two samples is the same even if some other parts are not.\n\nMaybe it helps to work with an example:\n\n##### Input document\n\nWe start with an EBU-TT-D document that contains:\n\n``` xml\n<p begin=\"00:00:00\" end=\"00:01:00\">Subtitle 1</p>\n<p begin=\"00:00:30\" end=\"00:01:30\">Subtitle 2</p>\n<p begin=\"00:01:00\" end=\"00:01:30\">Subtitle 3</p>\n```\n\nLet's say we want, for the sake of example, 5x18s samples. My assumption is that the parts of the document that overlap with each sample period would be extracted, without further editing, which gives:\n\n##### Sample 1 [0-18)s\n\n``` xml\n<p begin=\"00:00:00\" end=\"00:01:00\">Subtitle 1</p>\n```\n\n##### Sample 2 [18-36)s\n\n``` xml\n<p begin=\"00:00:00\" end=\"00:01:00\">Subtitle 1</p>\n<p begin=\"00:00:30\" end=\"00:01:30\">Subtitle 2</p>\n```\n\n##### Sample 3 [36-54)s\n\n``` xml\n<p begin=\"00:00:00\" end=\"00:01:00\">Subtitle 1</p>\n<p begin=\"00:00:30\" end=\"00:01:30\">Subtitle 2</p>\n```\n\n##### Sample 4 [54-72)s\n\n``` xml\n<p begin=\"00:00:00\" end=\"00:01:00\">Subtitle 1</p>\n<p begin=\"00:00:30\" end=\"00:01:30\">Subtitle 2</p>\n<p begin=\"00:01:00\" end=\"00:01:30\">Subtitle 3</p>\n```\n\n##### Sample 5 [72-90)s\n\n``` xml\n<p begin=\"00:00:30\" end=\"00:01:30\">Subtitle 2</p>\n<p begin=\"00:01:00\" end=\"00:01:30\">Subtitle 3</p>\n```\n\nAs you can see, samples 2 and 3 do end up being the same, so I guess that 3 could be marked as redundant by @cconcolato's logic above. However each consecutive sample does contain one or more `<p>`s that's in an adjacent sample too, but in general the samples are not redundant.\n\nBy the way, the presentation behaviour for those 5 samples should by the specification be indistinguishable from that when the EBU-TT-D processing also modifies the begin and end times to match the sample times, for example sample 2 could become:\n\n``` xml\n<p begin=\"00:00:18\" end=\"00:00:36\">Subtitle 1</p>\n<p begin=\"00:00:30\" end=\"00:00:36\">Subtitle 2</p>\n```\n\nand sample 3 could become:\n\n``` xml\n<p begin=\"00:00:36\" end=\"00:00:54\">Subtitle 1</p>\n<p begin=\"00:00:36\" end=\"00:00:54\">Subtitle 2</p>\n```\n\nPresumably if you did that then you could not use the redundant flag for sample 3?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/83500070/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/84043978", "body": "@cconcolato We're in almost complete agreement here. A couple of finer points:\n\n>  if a document is stored in a sample and you have to add a segment boundary in the middle of that sample (for instance because the segment durations are advertised in the MPD with an approximately constant duration), the sample has to be duplicated in the next segment.\n\nThis is a special case where a) you don't want to create multiple samples AND b) you don't want to make the segment duration in the subtitle Representation the same as the sample duration. I'm not sure why you'd want this, since the subtitle segment duration does not need to have the same segment duration as e.g. the video. So I don't get the application/use case for this scenario even if I'm sure the statement is correct.\n\n> in practice, the edited version would require terminating the rendering of the previous sample and loading/rendering the new one. That might introduce glitches. The redundant flag is a better option I think.\n\nIn the general case it is required to terminate the rendering of the previous sample and beginning rendering the new one. It's unlikely that all samples with any kind of duplication will be able to have the redundant flag set since achieving that would be too difficult for the document author, given that he/she will not know the segment and sample boundaries that will be used at distribution time, and in any case the editorial requirement will be unrelated to those boundaries. \n\nIt's an implementation requirement to avoid glitches on sample boundaries if the presented content in the adjacent boundary frames is the same, regardless of the redundant flag. If I were testing an implementation that glitched e.g. between any adjacent pairs of samples in my example from comment #57 then I would fail that implementation, regardless of the redundant flag or whether the content had been clipped to the sample period or left unchanged.\n\nGoing back to the idea of a single sample that is for some reason presented in multiple segments, is there any spec text missing from e.g. [Tech3381](https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3381.pdf), to state that in this scenario the document can remain active across segment boundaries? Just wondering because it isn't a scenario that I think we considered.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/84043978/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/84130112", "body": "What's good about this discussion is that it's clear that there are different starting assumptions, not surprisingly, from different perspectives, e.g. authors, packagers and receivers, and it's important for the whole chain to work and for interoperability to get any kinks in understanding straightened out. We both simultaneously think we're in agreement with each other, and seem to be recognising that there may be challenges from another perspective that we maybe hadn't fully considered.\n\nI'd also add that it's quite hard to discuss all the options in a github thread. I'd be open to a telco or even a face to face meeting to go through the various scenarios and understand what all the parties want to achieve and how they think it would/could work.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll try to respond:\n\n> Or rather, you don't want to change the TTML content, yes.\n\nJust to understand this right, by \"change the TTML content\" you mean \"create any new TTML documents at all\"? My view so far has been that the process of extracting relevant parts of the initial document, without otherwise modifying them, and using them to synthesise new smaller documents is not a _change_ to the content in itself, but is in fact the process for creating time-restricted samples of TTML.\n\nIf you don't want to do that at all, and you have the TTML for the whole programme, then yes, you could just have that one document be the sample, and I don't see any particular problem with the redundant flag approach. It'd be bad for data rates and processing if implementations kept on fetching the same data and reprocessing it though!\n\n> In some live cases, segments have to respect some constraints on their duration, to avoid drift in segment adresses. \n\nOkay, this is something I need to look into more - I thought this wasn't a problem. Is it a practical issue rather than a theoretical one? What are the attributes of the live cases that make them susceptible to this?\n\n> In multiplexed representations, you want to keep the subtitle data aligned with the media data.\n\nThis could mean a couple of things, so can I unpack what you mean? By \"multiplexed representations\" are you talking about Representations containing multiple Sub-Representations, one of which contains the subtitle media content component? Or do you mean Representations that contain MPEG-2 transport stream Media Segments that contain multiplexed content? I don't think anyone has defined the carriage of TTML in MPEG-2 TS yet, so it'd be good if we can rule that out for the time being.\n\nAssuming you mean the first one, yes, I can see that the segment boundaries are the same for all the Sub-Representations present. \n\nSo I think I get that use case now, thanks.\n\n> I'm thinking the segmenter would create those redundant samples, as it's easier than to edit the TTML content.\n\nIt's actually pretty easy (computationally, and in code) to pull out the TTML content that overlaps any given defined time period from a single document covering a longer period. I've seen an XSLT that can do it, for example. It's even simpler in EBU-TT-D than generic TTML because some of the time calculation complexities are reduced. MP4Box seems to have code to do this already.\n\nBut yes, doing _no_ processing is always easier than doing _some_ processing!\n\nSince _some_ packagers will create temporal samples from the TTML, and it's allowed in the specs, it follows that _all_ receiver implementations need to be able to handle it. I think that's the macro point here. I'm very happy with any assistance that can be provided in packaging and any optimisations in implementations to help provide the right user experience.\n\nSo ...\n\n> I'm not sure I follow here. The document author may not have the information about the segment duration, but the segmenter has that information.\n\nWe maybe were coming from two different starting points: I thought we were talking about a model where TTML samples matching the segment period were being extracted from the source TTML; I now see that you weren't saying that. In the model I had in mind, my point was simply that there is no and can be no fixed relationship between the begin and end times in the original (pre-sampling) TTML and the segment times, meaning that some TTML content will end up being reproduced in adjacent samples some of the time.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/84130112/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/85039617", "body": "It feels as though we've almost reached the end of this discussion, with some useful notes for future reference. I agree with the points about where the processing should happen, and the proposed model is fine for me. \n\nAttempting to summarise:\n- It is the role of the Encoder to take TTML input documents and create samples of TTML suitable for packaging.\n- It is the role of the Packager to create DASHed output including or referencing those encoded samples.\n- Encoders may create multiple samples of TTML (e.g. EBU-TT-D) that have defined sample periods in ISOBMFF but have timed (TTML) content that extends outside those periods;\n- Encoders do not have to do this and could create a single long sample for the duration of the media content;\n- Packagers may create multiple DASH segments that reference the same TTML sample;\n- Packagers may label the redundant samples as 'redundant = true';\n- Adjacent TTML samples may contain some duplicated content, e.g. a timed content element that extends across the sample boundary may be in both the samples.\n- Packagers must not label non-identical samples as redundant even if they partially overlap;\n- If the desired DASHed output has segments with distinct samples, e.g. for live content, then the encoder needs to be aware of the desired segment boundaries and create the TTML samples to match (or an integral number of samples that matches the segment duration\n- Decoders may take advantage of the redundant flag to extend the active duration of a sample\n- Decoders must ensure that zero or one TTML sample in a media component (i.e with the same `@id`) is active at any given moment on the media timeline. It is an error to permit two or more samples to be active simultaneously even if their content overlaps in time.\n- On sample and segment boundaries, any presented content that is the same before and after the boundary point the implementation must not have a visible glitch in presentation.\n\nBefore we consider closing this, I just want to check if there are any remaining unresolved questions.\n\nIn particular:\n- are the models for DASHing and playback clear enough?\n- are there any remaining points of debate?\n- are there scenarios that are under-specified by 14496-30, 23009 and/or Tech3381?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/issues/comments/85039617/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gpac/gpac/pulls/comments/96835631", "body": "These two `tt:p` elements are not in the TTML namespace; since this is an EBU-TT-D example file it is invalid for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1.
