The only difference is that it will be called a lot more.\n\nIt could be even improved a bit more to be something like this:\n- `require_server` receives a parameter that should be the API call that's being called (e.g. `:create`, `:is_meeting_running`)\n- `require_server` **always** calls `select_server` passing the API method. If a server is returned, it sets the server in the room and saves the room. Otherwise it doesn't do anything.\n- If the room has no server at the end of this, `require_server` should still raise an exception (as it does today).\n- `select_server` by default should only select a server if the room has no server yet. Otherwise it returns `nil`.\n\nThis seems flexible enough for people to override `select_server` and decide when it has to change the server of a room and when it doesn't need to.\nBy default it will also make sure that a room always has a server before any API call is made.\n\nWhat do you think?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/106061989/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/106066651", "body": "Have you tried using this with Mconf-Web?\nTry to use it there, set a default layout to a meeting and check if it will work.

When creating a meeting, it will set the layout as \"Webinar\", but BigBlueButton won't recognize it. It would only recognize the key \"presentfocus\".\n\nThe solution I see is to have a separate method that returns the localized layouts. Something like `available_layouts_names`. Mconf-Web will then have to be adapted to use both `available_layouts` and `available_layouts_names`, whenever appropriate.\n\nI also think `available_layouts_names` should be on `BigbluebuttonServerConfig`, the model that actually stores the layouts. `BigbluebuttonServer` and `BigbluebuttonRoom` can then just delegate to it.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/106066651/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/147466240", "body": "Thank you :smile: \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/147466240/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/153131101", "body": "Your `BigbluebuttonRoom` instance has no server associated to it, so the gem doesn't know where to send API requests to.

See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bigbluebutton-dev/Cz9zcPbRZfI/CLX1IdQgA9AJ\n\nThe current version of @BigbluebuttonRails@ uses unique global meetingIDs for conferences and so the generation of random meetingIDs was removed.\nWith static meetingIDs the problem we have is what is described in this issue: https://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/issues/detail?id=1324\nIn short, a meeting that finish can stay in memory in the BigBlueButton server for a while, and while it is there the user won't be able to create the meeting again with, for example, different parameters to set the record flag.\n\nThe proposed solution is:\n- Check if the meeting is running. If it is, we don't need to create the meeting again.\n- If it is not running, call 'end' to finish the old meeting and only then create it again.\n\nThis has to be implemented and tested against a real server.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896535/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896536", "body": "---\n\nOriginal Redmine Comment\nAuthor Name: **Leonardo Daronco** (Leonardo Daronco)\nOriginal Date: 2014-08-12T16:18:39Z\n\n---\n\nChecking if a meeting is running or not is not always ideal. A meeting can be in memory but not running if there's no one in it. A better solution would be to find if the meeting is in memory or not.\n\nSo the gem should either:\n1. Call @end@ always in case the meeting is not running (as proposed in the comment above); or\n2. Instead of calling @isMeetingRunning@ to check if the meeting is running, the gem could call @getMeetingInfo@. It would also have the @running@ flag in it, but would also indicate whether the meeting is created (in memory) or not. If it is in memory (running or not), the gem should call an @end@ first. Otherwise it doesn't need to call @end@.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896536/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896555", "body": "---\n\nOriginal Redmine Comment\nAuthor Name: **Leonardo Daronco** (Leonardo Daronco)\nOriginal Date: 2013-03-15T17:54:34Z\n\n---\n\nThis is more relevant in BigbluebuttonRails\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896555/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896557", "body": "---\n\nOriginal Redmine Comment\nAuthor Name: **Leonardo Daronco** (Leonardo Daronco)\nOriginal Date: 2013-03-15T19:29:25Z\n\n---\n\nDone https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/compare/9db8aa55a2...c2f88dee652\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896557/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896570", "body": "---\n\nOriginal Redmine Comment\nAuthor Name: **Fernando Bottin** (Fernando Bottin)\nOriginal Date: 2013-04-26T05:13:24Z\n\n---\n\nApplied in changeset bigbluebutton_rails|commit:67ca750f46d1b33c64e7f818a61a47046402a077.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896570/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896616", "body": "---\n\nOriginal Redmine Comment\nAuthor Name: **Leonardo Daronco** (Leonardo Daronco)\nOriginal Date: 2014-10-23T16:35:29Z\n\n---\n\nSee https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/pull/17\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896616/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896650", "body": "---\n\nOriginal Redmine Comment\nAuthor Name: **Leonardo Daronco** (Leonardo Daronco)\nOriginal Date: 2013-04-10T19:43:40Z\n\n---\n\nApplied in changeset bigbluebutton_rails|commit:08fb4e5ecd4a998fd752959af29fba75db85a9f2.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896650/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896674", "body": "---\n\nOriginal Redmine Comment\nAuthor Name: **Leonardo Daronco** (Leonardo Daronco)\nOriginal Date: 2013-04-10T19:43:40Z\n\n---\n\nApplied in changeset bigbluebutton_rails|commit:a071f7d67798757f11656511e6e9b651abb5759b.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896674/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896693", "body": "---\n\nOriginal Redmine Comment\nAuthor Name: **Fernando Bottin** (Fernando Bottin)\nOriginal Date: 2013-05-02T18:16:27Z\n\n---\n\nApplied in changeset bigbluebutton_rails|commit:9b6dcc1bd5263984c54710c5b004f6e897e4ed26.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896693/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/issues/comments/216896763", "body": "---\n\nOriginal Redmine Comment\nAuthor Name: **Leonardo Daronco** (Leonardo Daronco)\nOriginal Date: 2014-01-28T01:11:48Z\n\n---\n\nFully implemented and tested.\n\nRight now the only parameter the gem allows the user to change in the config.xml is the default layout.

If the meeting takes longer than the time the worker waits before running, the worker won't find the meeting in the web conference server. Maybe it should try more that once to find the meeting (or simply trigger another worker if it fails, until it finds something). See #1065.\n- List meetings and add actions to modify and remove them.
