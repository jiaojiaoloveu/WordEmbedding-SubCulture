When you try to add to the group a server that has\n  more data than the existing members, by default the joining member\n  will be rejected.\n  The purpose is to avoid possible recovery and run time errors in\n  the plugin leading to data divergence and other issues. If you are\n  sure of what you are doing, and that the extra data is safe, then\n  you can use this option.\n\nThe scenarios on which this can help users are:\n\n S1) Solve a broken majority asap\n     * Group had 3 members in single-primary mode\n     * 2 members crashed and end up with different data\n       (GTID_EXECUTED) when compared with the group.\n     * User wants to add one of the members (S2) to solve the\n       majority loss or increase group members number to handle\n       possible future member failures.\n     * The member that is still on the group is the one that is the\n       primary or will be elected as primary when majority is\n       re-established, since is the only one ONLINE.\n     * The group will be stable if a future failover does not switch\n       to the S2 member.\n\nThe runtime errors that may happen are that the member which did\nforce the join with disjoint GTIDS, if it does a write, the changed\nrows will never be updated by other members. Certification will\nfail.\nThe recovery errors that may happen are that if this member is\nchosen as donor, it will distribute the disjoint GTIDS among the new\nmembers and increase the likelihood of the runtime errors to happen.\n\nIt must never be used unless the DBA knows exactly what she/he is\ndoing or does need to solve a broken majority, on which crashed\nmembers suffered corruption and she/he will not perform writes on\nit. Which can already be done by resetting master and setting\nGTID_PURGED to match the GTID executed of the group if they really\nwant to add the damaged server to the group.\n\nPeople use this option to force member join, and assume that since\nmember did successfully join everything is OK. Which is not the\ncase, data is inconsistent.\n\nThe correct procedure to fix a majority loss is described at\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/group-replication-network-partitioning.html\n\nSince the trade-off between this option benefit vs danger is\nnegative, we are deprecating this option.\nIt will be removed on a future version."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mysql/mysql-server/commits/9a2f4abbb85880b91b46f6157bf8692b73d86da2", "message": "BUG#27008102: CRASH DURING SHUTDOWN WHEN START GR EXECUTED IF MAX CONNECTIONS ALREADY OPENED\nBUG#27016552: MAX_CONNECTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR GR INTERNAL CONNECTIONS\n\nGroup Replication does use the SQL API to execute internal\noperations on the server during START and STOP, like enable and\ndisable read only mode.\nWhile opening this internal connection, if the server already\nreached the max_connections value, Group Replication was failing as\nexpected but a dangling thread was left behind, which later would\ncause issues.\n\nThis patch addresses that issue, by handling completely the open\nconnection failure scenario.\nThis patch also improves the error messages on this error scenario,\nby including the internal server error and message, and on the\nparticular case of max_connections also instructing the user what\nneeds to be changed."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mysql/mysql-server/commits/b4a7d68a5c06b8f1df283570dbd5f12b46285e80", "message": "BUG#26770576: ALL MEMBERS ARE EXITED FROM GR WHEN 1/3 NODE TRIED TO REJOIN AFTER SHUTDOWN\n\nProblem: All members in group goes in ERROR STATE when new member joins and\ncertification database is big\n\nScenario (slow machine with heavy load):\n1.
