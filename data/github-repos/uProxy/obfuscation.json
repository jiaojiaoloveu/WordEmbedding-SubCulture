Unfortunately, the commands to execute are more complex than `./configure && make ...`, hence it's abstracted as a vagrant build. In [1] I try to justify the relatively complex build process.\n\nI also tried to breakdown the build into modular components [2]. For example, the build process for uTransformers is in [3], but requires that all dependencies are installed. The hurdles are that (1) uTransformers dependencies are complex to build under emscripten and (2) for performance reasons, we must compile emscripten from source.\n\nIdeally, libfte would be an npm module in it's own right (and rabbit too) then we could make uTransformers into a pure javascript/typescript project.\n\n### References\n\n[1] https://github.com/uProxy/uTransformers/tree/master/vagrant\n[2] https://github.com/uProxy/uTransformers/blob/master/vagrant/bootstrap.sh\n[3] https://github.com/uProxy/uTransformers/blob/master/vagrant/build_utransformers.sh\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/UWNetworksLab/uProxy-obfuscators/issues/comments/48141548/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "COLLABORATOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/UWNetworksLab/uProxy-obfuscators/issues/comments/48627085", "body": "**Summary of issue:** To increase runtime performance, we pre-compute a lookup table in `uTransformers.fte.configure`. The size of this table for the plaintext language is roughly (number of states in the dfa) x (`plaintext_max_len`) x (a small constant) bytes. (And replacing `ciphertext_max_len` similarly for the ciphertext language.) So, by changing the regex, this table size can decrease/increase, depending upon the number of states in the minimal DFA. This table is the culprit behind the `Cannot enlarge memory arrays` error.\n\nFortunately, we can ameliorate this issue on three fronts:\n- There will soon be a new release of libfte. This release of libfte will treat `.*` and `.+` as special cases. Lookup tables will not be required, and we'll have even faster runtime performance. This means the input plaintext language will require nearly-zero memory for `.*` and `.+`.\n- We'll enable `ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH` in uTransformers, assuming it doesn't negatively impact performance.\n- Then, as Shanjian says, we'll probably never want `ciphertext_max_len` to exceed ~1500.\n\nWith the three changes above, I expect we shouldn't encounter memory issues again, unless we start exploring super-complex regexes with a large number of DFA states.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/UWNetworksLab/uProxy-obfuscators/issues/comments/48627085/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "COLLABORATOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/UWNetworksLab/uProxy-obfuscators/issues/comments/48693837", "body": "This is an odd problem, because it appears that rabbit is working well in `uTransformers.rabbit`.
