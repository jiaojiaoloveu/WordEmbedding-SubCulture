It is perhaps time to rewrite it from scratch to make it easier to understand. Now I need **your** help to get it done.\n### Mock ups\n\nSend mock ups of how you would like the preference dialog to be rearranged to be easier to use and understand. Let your creativity flow freely as long as you remember that the key focus is on making something that is _easier to use_.\n### Language\n\nEnglish isn't my native language and I have a bit of a  fondness for playing with words which doesn't always help when you need to write short informative sentences. Help me improve the wording in the texts to make the language more clear. This will help not only the end user, but also the translators who will have an easier job of translating when they don't have to start by guessing what the original text really means.\n### Opinions\n\nEven if you can't make mock ups or don't speak English well enough to improve the language you can share your opinions of what things in the dialog you find most confusing and what you think should be changed.\n\nBelow are screenshots of how DockbarX preferences dialog looks like right now in untranslated English. Some options (regrettably far from all of them) have tooltips. Sadly they don't show up on screenshots.  \n![dbx preference page 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7893626/3467464/3016e8de-0291-11e4-80a9-fb4c3ac4ab88.png)\n![dbx preference page 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7893626/3467465/3017493c-0291-11e4-8d93-7c9d21e7c89c.png)\n![dbx preference page 3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7893626/3467466/3018f9b2-0291-11e4-933f-90ef3d77f6ac.png)\n![dbx preference page 4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7893626/3467467/3019626c-0291-11e4-9493-ab88dfe30451.png)\n![dbx preference page 5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7893626/3467468/301c2740-0291-11e4-98a1-c5d5512efadf.png)\n![dbx preference page 6](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7893626/3467469/301c6764-0291-11e4-8b97-903b251bb220.png)\n![dbx preference page 7](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7893626/3467471/302ea668-0291-11e4-9b40-98fb609ed3b4.png)\n![dbx preference page 8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7893626/3467470/302eac9e-0291-11e4-8682-442acb0aabd3.png)\nThe AWN tab screenshot is missing since it only shows up if AWN is running and right now I'm not on a computer with AWN installed.

I've made some mockups of a much cleaner design. I love this dock but the settings dialogue has always been a bit daunting. I hope I can be useful!\n\nI made sure every option is still configurable but some are done in a more humanistic way. I got lazy near the end and didn't do the other two tabs for mouse/keyboard and I still haven't done the popup dialogues that are activated with the 'gear' icon. If this is agreeable, the skeleton (and much of the meat) is all there. I changed only a few words around, I figured we could work on the language after the design has been implemented.\n\nAlso, I hope that lightswitches is an acceptable widget to use; I'm not sure if you support GTK2 or GTK3. If not GTK3, we can make do without them.\n\nThanks so much for such an amazing piece of software.  \n\nSome suggestions for the present:\n\nFirstly, right clicking on the bar to configure says 'properties'. Properties is a word defining an object and gives no indication to configure the dockbar. 'Configure' or 'Customize' would be better terminology. \n\nSecondly, the configuration window should not have a 'close' button: that's what the x is for at the top-right of your window!\n\nHow liberal shall I be on filing bug reports/pull requests?\n![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5383525/3576670/b30143b4-0b94-11e4-92fb-32fde00a2faf.png)\n![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5383525/3576667/b3006174-0b94-11e4-8823-b61645068767.png)\n![3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5383525/3576669/b3011510-0b94-11e4-9f6b-f05779d5ff5a.png)\n![4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5383525/3576668/b300fda0-0b94-11e4-892b-761d573c2d3a.png)\n![5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5383525/3576671/b33fc6a2-0b94-11e4-9a56-9c568d6930bc.png)\n![6](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5383525/3576666/b300678c-0b94-11e4-9087-7f9d92187ad4.png)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/M7S/dockbarx/issues/comments/48954453/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/M7S/dockbarx/issues/comments/48972514", "body": "On my singling of themes in the 'appearance' pane, my rationale is thusly:\n\nUser can select from available themes with the single drop-down menu.
