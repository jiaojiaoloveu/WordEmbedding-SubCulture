answer from stackoverflow looks more elaborate. I will try that tomorrow. Otherwise the libraries and source file are OK. in Debian libX11.so.6 is part of package libx11-6 and the header file X11/Xlib.h is part of libx11-dev. Both are properly installed otherwise it won't compile. We have a problem at link time, meaning some compilation options are missing.\n\nWhat you all think about that ?\n\nWell as I was about to close I found this link which is closer to our problem and bolster my own impression.\n\nhttps://github.com/tum-vision/lsd_slam/issues/29\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/23585435/cannot-call-xinitthreads\n\n`\"undefined reference to symbol\"` is a linker error, not a compiler error.

Afaict , flows are an implementation detail that might be better to left hidden, and the API could let me simply provide timestamped \"reference frames\", and, depending on the defined configuration, interpolate the required amount of \"fill frames\", which I'd retrieve in the callback I provided.\n\nThese are just random thoughts though, maybe providing a lower level API akin to the the one I'm using in that port would be better, but if a higher-level API can be provided that would allow fully exploiting the features of the library I guess that would be better, my main concern here being that the notion of \"control flow\" might be something you don't want to expose if you can afford not to, as users like me will not want to learn such implementation \"details\".\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slowmoVideo/slowmoVideo/issues/comments/175508791/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "ckorn": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slowmoVideo/slowmoVideo/issues/comments/171474793", "body": "Thanks, the master branch worked.\n\nJust published it for Ubuntu 15.10:\nhttp://www.getdeb.net/app/slowmoVideo\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slowmoVideo/slowmoVideo/issues/comments/171474793/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "letkan": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slowmoVideo/slowmoVideo/issues/comments/175719694", "body": "This is kind of long but I rendered once ill the end and then attempted a second time just changing the output file name.\n\n[slowmo.log.txt](https://github.com/slowmoVideo/slowmoVideo/files/106928/slowmo.log.txt)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slowmoVideo/slowmoVideo/issues/comments/175719694/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slowmoVideo/slowmoVideo/issues/comments/176269884", "body": "Open slowmoVideo, load a project so that you have images in both monitors\nand move the cursor in the grid area, in my case as I move the cursor I can\nsee in conky the amount of ram used increasing... and it stops only when I\nstop the mouse or run out of ram in which case the display is blocked.\nAnyway, thanks for looking into it.\n\nOn Thu, Jan 28, 2016 at 6:12 PM, valgit notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @petrica-celrau https://github.com/petrica-celrau can you give more\n> hint on how to reproduce/look at the problem ?\n> for now, the only thing I see is a change in all \"monitor\", not just\n> \"curve\", where there is now a cache of image instead of loading them each\n> time (less IO workload but more memory ...).\n> so maybe, there is a bug in the cache part (which is using qt qcache) ?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/slowmoVideo/slowmoVideo/issues/69#issuecomment-176255492\n> .\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slowmoVideo/slowmoVideo/issues/comments/176269884/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slowmoVideo/slowmoVideo/issues/comments/177171629", "body": "I applied the changes.\n1. on the first render the progress in the rendering progress window goes\nto only 50% then jumps to 100%; file is rendered correctly, I can close the\nrendering progress window.\n2. second render to new file: the progress in the rendering progress window\ngoes to only 50% then stops and can't close the window from the button, no\nfile is rendered.\n3. repeted step 1 with new file name, all OK.\n4. repeted step 2 except that this time I overwrite the previously renderd\nfile; rendering goes to 50%, stops and then starts again from 0.
