We tried running it with maven options as follows, but apparently the blob is too big:\n\n```\nexport MAVEN_OPTS=\"-XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Xmx2048m\"\n```\n\nAfter doing some debugging it looks like the plugin is trying to load the whole commit into memory. I understand it is being transcoded into something else and probably gets bigger. I also understand that this is egit problem, they choose to pull the entire commit into memory instead of streaming it.\n\nIncreasing it further does not help much, the OS itself starts running out of memory:\n\n```\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: INFO: os::commit_memory(0x00000007be1e9000, 568422400, 0) failed; error='Cannot allocate memory' (errno=12)\n```\n\nAfter quick look into the code I couldn't come up with a reasonable patch for this. I think ideal solution would be to stream the contents rather than loading the whole thing into memory. I am not familiar with egit and not sure if it has this capability... Alternatively, one can split large commits into separate files and thus make it work, however, it is a cludge, and it can potentially create inconsistent commits.\n\nSo for now we are going to switch off the plug-in, cache artifacts somewhere else and push them into github manually via regular git commands. If you need my help testing this, I'd be more than happy to assist.\n\nThe versions are:\n\n```\nApache Maven 3.3.9 (bb52d8502b132ec0a5a3f4c09453c07478323dc5; 2015-11-10T11:41:47-05:00)\nMaven home: /usr/local/maven/default\nJava version: 1.7.0_75, vendor: Oracle Corporation\nJava home: /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_75/jre\nDefault locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8\nOS name: \"linux\", version: \"4.1.13-boot2docker\", arch: \"amd64\", family: \"unix\"\n```\n\nThank you very much for your work on supporting this project.

Configure `<distributionManagement>` as dummy to get the URL from:\n   \n   ``` xml\n   <distributionManagement>\n     <site>\n       <id>github-pages-site</id>\n       <name>Deployment through GitHub's site deployment plugin</name>\n       <url>site/${project.version}</url>\n     </site>\n   </distributionManagement>\n   \n   ```\n2. Disable deployment for the `maven-site-plugin` (in this example you also see how to add markdown to your site):\n   \n   ``` xml\n   <plugin>\n     <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n     <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>\n     <version>3.1</version>\n     <dependencies>\n       <dependency>\n         <!--\n         | allows markdown syntax for site generation.

However, up until recently the API was more forgiving about this field. Specifically, if you passed in a SHA of a commit (and not a SHA of a tree), the API detected this and fetched the SHA of the tree which the commit pointed to and used that as input. In other words, the API handled undocumented input in an expected way.\n\nRecently, this behavior changed in the way that the API no longer supports this undocumented behavior. The error which the API is returning in this case is currently not very helpful (a 409 indicating that there's a problem with the repository), and that's a bug which will be fixed soon. Still, the process which is interacting with the API should be passing in the correct value as the base_tree -- it should be a SHA of a tree object, not a SHA of a commit object, as documented.\n\nI'm really sorry that this is causing problems for you. Since this change didn't affect documented behavior, we didn't blog about it in advance. \n\n@cescoffier @kevinsawicki -- my Java is weak, so heads up on this in case you can fix this or want to accept a pull request from someone in the community.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/github/maven-plugins/issues/comments/53956789/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/github/maven-plugins/issues/comments/53963338", "body": "Thanks @bguerin!
