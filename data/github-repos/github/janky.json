Separates build and test phases so that it's clear which one failed (this only matters for compiled projects, I think)\n2. Parses JUnit-style XML files to give a [formatted view of test results](https://builds.apache.org/job/Cassandra-Coverage/192/testReport/) and can [aggregate these results into graphs](https://builds.apache.org/job/Cassandra-Coverage/test/?width=800&height=600)\n\nJanky's output is by comparison far more spartan.

Typically generated by a tool like pwgen.\nJANKY_AUTH_CLIENT_ID: The client ID of the OAuth application.\nJANKY_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: The client secret of the OAuth application.\nJANKY_AUTH_ORGANIZATION: The organization name. Example: \"github\".\n```\n\nSo I register the OAuth app for my org, and plug in the the `JANKY_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `JANKY_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` for the app.  `JANKY_AUTH_ORGANIZATION` is of course my org name (EastPoint) in this case.  I randomly generate 16 characters for `JANKY_SESSION_SECRET`.\n\nIf I try to hit the url of my Janky install, it looks like it's working.  The app immediately redirects to \n\n```\nhttps://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=JANKY_AUTH_CLIENT_ID&scope=repo&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FMY.JANKY.SITE%2Fauth%2Fgithub%2Fcallback\n```\n\nI click `Allow` to authorize and the OAuth flow continues with a 302 to\n\n```\nhttps://MY.JANKY.SITE/auth/github/callback?code=THECODE\n```\n\nWhen the request goes to my server, I have one `rack.session` and I'm assigned a new one,  and a 302 is sent which redirects me to the root of the site\n\n```\nhttps://MY.JANKY.SITE/\n```\n\nAt this point, a request is sent back to `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?` and it loops. As far as I can tell,  it would appear that Janky is either unable to lookup `THECODE` passed back from Github,  or is having some sort of issue properly managing / associating the given `rack.session` with the OAuth flow that just occurred.\n\nThere's nothing in the logs (is there a way to turn on something more verbose?)\n\nIs there some system-level dependency that I might be missing that could be preventing the calls back to GitHub by the Janky server from succeeding?\n\nSome notes about my environment, for completeness - everything here checks out:\n- Not running on Heroku - running on EC2 - Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS - have the following packages installed - `sudo apt-get -y install curl ssh git-core git build-essential zlib1g zlib1g-dev libyaml-dev libxml2-dev libc6-dev autoconf automake libtool make postgresql postgresql-client postgresql-contrib libpq-dev ruby1.9.3 ruby1.9.1-dev rubygems1.9.1 ruby-bundler`, and I've also done an `install rubygems-update`\n- Ruby 1.9.3 (yes, I have made sure that default Ruby is not 1.8 -- see [here](http://lenni.info/blog/2012/05/installing-ruby-1-9-3-on-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pengolin/))\n- Postgres 9.1 -- I can connect to and see the relevant tables in the database that I've called `janky_production` - I've tested my connection configuration in `irb` and it's fine.\n- Running under Upstart - using [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to generate the Upstart scripts - `RAILS_ENV` and `RACK_ENV` are both set to `production`\n- I created an authorization for my `JANKY_GITHUB_USER` and have configured `JANKY_GITHUB_STATUS_TOKEN` with the token\n- `JANKY_SESSION_SECRET` is a randomly generated 16 character string from `pwgen` per the docs suggestion.  Similarly `JANKY_GITHUB_HOOK_SECRET` has been generated in the same manner.\n- Hubot is configured properly with `hubot-scripts` and a `HUBOT_JANKY_URL`.  I can verify in HipChat that his part is working.  I can issue Hubot commands like `ci?` and the Janky result is properly parsed from `https://MY.JANKY.SITE/_hubot/help` as an example.  However, if I issue a command like `ci setup github/janky janky` I get the response `Error F7U12: Can't Setup.`\n- The Url configured for `JANKY_BUILDER_DEFAULT` is using basic auth over HTTPS.  This same basic url we've configured as a `WebHook Url` under the `Service Hooks` for the GitHub repo.  The webhook is using the Jenkins token style like `https://JANKY_GITHUB_USER:JENKINS_TOKEN@JENKINS..DOMAINcom/github-webhook/`.  The `JANKY_BUILDER_DEFAULT` looks identical, except that it doesn't have the `github-webhook/` part.\n- I can see the user count increase for the GitHub application assigned to `JANKY_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, and I can see the application listed as approved under my user account -- so I know that GitHub side has properly handled the OAuth request from Janky ... it's just that Janky seems to be missing something.\n\nI've double and triple checked all my environment variables to make sure they match up, but it's possible I've done something stupid here.  \n\nOn the double-checking front, I've also discovered an undocumented `JANKY_AUTH_TEAM_ID` at https://github.com/github/janky/blob/master/lib/janky.rb#L155  I have configured this to the integer id for the `Developers` team of my organization, and I am a member.  I will add a new issue for updating the docs with a description of this.\n\nA couple other last gory, related details -- again, only mentioned for completeness really.\n- I am running two other apps hosted on EC2 that have GitHub OAuth enabled - Jenkins and ErrBit.  Both of these apps work totally fine, so I'm familiar with the process of setting up OAuth.  All of our users are automatically logged into these apps if they are logged into GitHub.\n- Technically speaking, at the network infrastructure level, these apps (Jenkins, Errbit and Janky) are running behind a reverse proxy setup. NGinx performs SSL termination, then forwards the request to HAProxy, which reverse proxies based on host header and forwards the request to an internal server -- so directly at the Janky instances listening thin app, default port 5000.  I hesitated to mention this, because I don't want to confuse the issue here, as we do have the `proxy_set_header` configurations in place.  I mention this only because maybe, just maybe, there's something different going on in the headers (than all the other apps we reverse proxy that work fine).  This piece of setup in `nginx.conf` has worked fine for years --\n\n```\nlocation / {\n                #proxy to haproxy\n                proxy_pass              http://localhost:80;\n                proxy_set_header        Host $host;\n                proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto https;\n\n                proxy_redirect          off;\n        }\n```\n\nI think that covers it... lots of detail here -- hopefully someone can point me to what I'm missing!\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/github/janky/issues/111/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commits": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/github/janky/commits/9a1c0c381cbb04fc0dd8edd99aaa16a6156e867b", "message": "Update job configs / exclude template from ID\n\nIf an existing job is found, it should be allowed to update.\nWithout this, the Jenkins job configuration dashboard grows out of\nhand with new jobs any time job templates change.\n\nAs such, MD5 job id should not include the job file contents.\n\nThere is enough uniqueness in job name generation without resorting\nto reading job file contents to affect the MD5 id.\n\nThis is pretty problematic if minor tweaks are made to the Jenkins\njob.xml.erb templates.

The disconnect is happening because hubot-hipchat uses the [HipChat XMPP interface](https://www.hipchat.com/help/category/xmpp) and this new Janky HipChat support is using the [HipChat REST API](https://www.hipchat.com/docs/api).\n\nThe [User objects in Hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/src/user.coffee) are free-form hashes with instances being created by the respective adapters with the only standard key being `name`.\n\nThe User instances [created by the hubot-hipchat adapter have a 'reply_to' attribute](https://github.com/hipchat/hubot-hipchat/blob/master/src/hipchat.coffee#L69) instead of the ['room' attribute the User instances from the campfire adapter have](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/src/adapters/campfire.coffee#L38).\n\nFix is to add this extra 'room' attribute and set it to the room name (i.e. something like 'Dev') since this is what Janky is expecting to pass around (vs a JID like 7557_dev@conf.hipchat.com) and also what the HipChat REST API is expecting.  We can easily infer the room name from a JID.  For instnace a JID of `7557_dev@conf.hipchat.com` has a room name of `dev`.\n\nI _think_ this is [all that is needed](https://github.com/schisamo/hubot-hipchat/commit/216fa542ca965e9c33ce32dcc758eb7ed10aba69) in `hubot-hipchat`:\n\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/src/hipchat.coffee b/src/hipchat.coffee\nindex 5836178..5736835 100644\n--- a/src/hipchat.coffee\n+++ b/src/hipchat.coffee\n@@ -67,12 +67,14 @@ class HipChat extends Adapter\n       author = (self.userForName from) or {}\n       author.name = from unless author.name\n       author.reply_to = channel\n+      author.room = self.roomNameFromJid(from)\n       hubot_msg = message.replace(mention, \"#{self.robot.name}: \")\n       self.receive new Robot.TextMessage(author, hubot_msg)\n\n     bot.onPrivateMessage (from, message) ->\n       author = self.userForId(self.userIdFromJid(from))\n       author.reply_to = from\n+      author.room = self.roomNameFromJid(from)\n       self.receive new Robot.TextMessage(author, \"#{self.robot.name}: #{message}\")\n\n     # Join rooms automatically when invited\n@@ -146,5 +148,8 @@ class HipChat extends Adapter\n   userIdFromJid: (jid) ->\n     return jid.match(/_(\\d+)@/)[1]\n\n+  roomNameFromJid: (jid) ->\n+    return jid.match(/_(\\w+)@/)[1]\n+\n exports.use = (robot) ->\n   new HipChat robot\n```\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/github/janky/issues/comments/3347297/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/github/janky/issues/comments/3386039", "body": "@sr are you waiting on me to merge your additional commits into my [schisamo/janky/hipchat-support](https://github.com/schisamo/janky/tree/hipchat-support) branch?
