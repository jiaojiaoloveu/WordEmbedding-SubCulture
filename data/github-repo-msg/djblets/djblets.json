Previously, expiration just meant clearing the value\nfrom cache, causing the next `get_current()` to re-fetch. Now, if there\nare any listeners for the signal, the new instance is fetched\nimmediately, so that it can be passed to the signal handler. This\nshouldn't impact any consumers. If no listeners are present, the new\ninstance is not fetched.\n\nA new method `get_for_site_id()` method was also added for use in\n`check_expired()`. This works like `get_current()`, but takes the ID of\na Django `Site`, handling caching. `get_current()` wraps this.\n\nThe docs throughout the file have been modernized, helping to keep this\nmaintainable going forward.\n\nTesting Done:\nAll unit tests for Djblets and Review Board pass.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/9481/", "tree": {"sha": "d1e57f42d17f2178b5bf5a1d5354c563cd5559af", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/d1e57f42d17f2178b5bf5a1d5354c563cd5559af"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/1b79cb380e9b6647101d1b94316651ff4459da22", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/1b79cb380e9b6647101d1b94316651ff4459da22", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/1b79cb380e9b6647101d1b94316651ff4459da22", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/1b79cb380e9b6647101d1b94316651ff4459da22/comments", "author": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "cf2185395f68ae2a20cef7aa6a5c230fb68a0117", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/cf2185395f68ae2a20cef7aa6a5c230fb68a0117", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/cf2185395f68ae2a20cef7aa6a5c230fb68a0117"}]}, {"sha": "cf2185395f68ae2a20cef7aa6a5c230fb68a0117", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2018-01-16T04:01:16Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2018-01-16T04:01:16Z"}, "message": "Include additional files in the package.\n\nDjblets 1.0 introduced SVG icons, which was used for higher DPIs.

We now start by including the\nentirety of the `contrib`, `djblets`, and `docs` directories, along with\nsome other specific files, and then selectively remove content from the\npackage. This gives us the various files like `*.map` and `*.svg`, while\nkeeping out files like `*.py` and vim swap files.\n\nSome other files, like `INSTALL` and `README`, are now specifically\nincluded. These were included before by default by setuptools, but\nthey've been added so that we can be more explicit about our coverage.\n\nFiles needed for building docs are also now present, allowing us to\nbuild docs without needing a Git source tree.\n\nTesting Done:\nBuilt packages before and after this change. Verified that the SVGs,\nMap files, and requirements.txt files were included, and nothing was\nmissing.\n\nCarefully inspected the file listings between what we've previously\nshipped and now, and against the source tree.\n\nBuilt all the docs from a source tree.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/9477/", "tree": {"sha": "988499323a945946dcd50e656955e8346a558af3", "url":

The field itself was fine, but the tests needed some\nwork.\n\nA big part of this was due to a difference in how signals worked on\nnewer versions of Django. When a weak reference disappeared under Django\n1.6, the connections would immediately be cleaned up, but on newer\nversions, they'd just be flagged for cleanup the next time `connect()`,\n`disconnect()`, or `_live_receivers()` was called, making our\n`Signal.receivers` check fail. The fix for this is to just call\n`_live_receivers()` instead in the tests, which will give us the correct\nresults and even let us specify the model we care about (simplifying a\nlot of test code).\n\nThe other problem was that one of the tests no longer made sense in\nnewer versions of Django. It was testing to make sure that a reused ID\nfrom a `Model.delete()` call wouldn't cause the wrong state to be looked\nup.

This was the result of the `AvatarServiceRegistry` attempting\nto self-manage the settings a bit too closely, checking during\npopulation and attribute accessors for whether stored IDs make sense\nwith regards to the currently-populated backends and erasing IDs that\ndon't currently map.\n\nThis meant that any IDs pertaining to backends owned by an extension\nthat hadn't yet initialized hooks could be lost when certain operations\nwere performed, with the data being erased from settings. Along with\nthis, shutting down an extension (such as during extension manager\nreload or when shutting down an Apache thread) would unregister the\nbackend, which would also remove the enabled/default backend IDs.\n\nThe fix is to simplify the accessors, population, and unregistration,\nremoving these side effects. IDs stored in settings are no longer\nremoved unless explicitly requested by disabling a matching backend\n(which can now be done based on the ID instead of the class) or changing\nthe default backend. Otherwise, they're preserved and loading takes into\naccount that these just might not be available yet.\n\nThis means that code can attempt to look up the default backend class or\nthe list of enabled backend classes before an extension registers a\nbackend, and then after registration, and the former information will\nexclude the registered class but the latter will include it, without\nhaving to repopulate. It also means that the former will be returned\nafter disabling the extension, but that the latter will once again be\nreturned after re-enabling.\n\nIf an administrator re-saves the list of enabled avatar backends and the\ndefault backend from the administration UI, the new settings will no\nlonger include any unregistered backends, which will keep settings from\nforever including backends from every extension ever loaded.\n\nUnit tests have been updated to test for this and to make some parts\nmore clear. There's also some improvements to documentation with the\nregistry that was noted while documenting new methods and building docs.\n\nTesting Done:\nAdded a custom backend, verified it was available in Avatar Settings.\nMade it the default and enabled it. Then I removed that custom backend\nand accessed pages, including Avatar Settings. Saw that I got log\nmessages about this not being available, but no crash. The backend wans't\nbeing shown in the list of available backends anymore. However, it was\nstill listed in the siteconfig settings payload.\n\nRe-enabled the backend and saw that it was once again working and\navailable in Avatar Settings.\n\nRe-disabled and saved Avatar Settings. Saw that the IDs were removed\nfrom siteconfig.\n\nUnit tests pass.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/9403/", "tree": {"sha": "dda18899a0bb0fe59bd7d0fbcc3824f74f36d8b2", "url":

OAuth2 scope generation and run it on demand instead of startup.\n\nThis change attempts to reduce startup time by generating OAuth2 tokens\nonly when first needed by the application, instead of when the scope\ndictionary is first being set up. A few changes were made in order to\nhelp reduce the overhead.\n\nFirst, `WebAPIScopeDictionary` is no longer a `dict` that self-populates\nwhen constructed, and its contents are no longer manually added/removed\nas extensions are enabled/disabled. Instead, `WebAPIScopeDictionary` is\na standard object that wraps and manages a `dict`, implementing a few\ndictionary functions (`__getitem__()`, `__contains__()`, `keys()`, and\n`iterkeys()`) needed by `oauth2_provider`. Instead of populating on\nconstruction, it populates whenever something needs to access the\ninternal dictionary, and only if it's empty.\n\nPopulation walks every resource tree it's tracking (the root resource\nand, when using `ExtensionEnabledWebAPIScopeDictionary`, each enabled\nextension's list of top-level resources). It now does this recursively,\npreventing the need to modify another data structure on each iteration,\nallowing it to only worry about populating the scope dictionary.\n\nThis simplifies things quite a lot, as the extension management now only\nhas to add/remove the list of resources for the extension and clear the\ndictionary. The scopes won't regenerate until needed. It's also now\nthread-safe, preventing several concurrent scope generations from\noccurring at the same time.\n\nThe scope list is now computed on demand from the dictionary, just like\nwith the standard version. This reduces how much memory we're using to\nkeep the list of scopes, since looking up the scope list from the\ndictionary is a pretty infrequent operation. Because of this, we no\nlonger need to override `OAuth2ProviderSettings.__getattr__`.\n\nThe overall result is a smaller, simpler class for handling scope\ngeneration that reduces startup time, reduces bookkeeping, is\nthread-safe, and more easily extensible.\n\nTesting Done:\nUnit tests pass.\n\nTested manually that the scopes weren't populated on startup, but that\nI could get the list when needed (triggering a generation).\n\nAlso tested that enabling/disabling an extension properly cleared the\nscopes, and requesting scopes again caused the new extension resources\nto be included in the scope dictionary.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/9269/", "tree": {"sha": "8c6abab29f091d7086bd3fc7f2713f716a1e67da", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/8c6abab29f091d7086bd3fc7f2713f716a1e67da"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/305e3467dade727b08f765a9479105622f469da8", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/305e3467dade727b08f765a9479105622f469da8", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/305e3467dade727b08f765a9479105622f469da8", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/305e3467dade727b08f765a9479105622f469da8/comments", "author": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "ae9282658d651eb55ef04e620f91d2f5b47dbf50", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/ae9282658d651eb55ef04e620f91d2f5b47dbf50", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/ae9282658d651eb55ef04e620f91d2f5b47dbf50"}]}, {"sha": "ae9282658d651eb55ef04e620f91d2f5b47dbf50", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-10-21T23:10:18Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-10-21T23:10:18Z"}, "message": "Clean up dead space and clipped icons in the datagrid's Edit Columns menu.\n\nThe styling for the Edit Columns menu for datagrids resulted in a lot of\nunclickable dead space around icons and text, requiring more precise\nclicking in order to add or remove columns.

Instead of\nfocusing entirely on avatars, the new support works on all image\nelements. There's a few key differences in the new method:\n\n1. The `srcset` capability check has been fixed. The old check attempted\n   to call `get()` on the test element, which is actually intended to\n   perform an HTTP request. The result was that `srcset` was never\n   marked as supported. The intent was to look up the DOM element from\n   the list, which has been fixed.\n\n2. The new method no longer attempts to parse an empty `srcset` or\n   change the image URL if the pixel ratio hasn't changed, reducing the\n   workload for images without `srcset` or when repeatedly called.\n\n3. The new method is also a standalone method, rather than a jQuery\n   method, lazily performing the DOM query only if needed, improving\n   performance on modern browsers that natively handle `srcset`.\n\nThe old avatar method, introduced within the 0.10 release cycle, has\nbeen removed. The only effective difference it had with the new support\nwas the addition of a CSS class, which wasn't used anywhere.\n\nThe old `.at2x` CSS mixin has been replaced with a new `.retina` mixin.\nThis one is based on the latest mixin from retinajs.com, but heavily\nmodified to allow usage of SVG files. When enabled, screen pixel ratios\nhigher than the highest ratio level (2x, 3x, etc.) specified will use\nthe SVG file instead, ensuring quality on all screen resolutions. The\nmixin for this has moved to a new file (`css/mixins/retina.less`), and a\na compatibility file and compatibility macro have been added.\n\nThe integrations list has also been updated to use ``srcset``.\n\nTesting Done:\nTested that the `srcset` support capability was reporting the correct\nvalue.\n\nTested that `.at2x()` continued to work as it did before.\n\nTested the new `.retina()` with multiple density levels and with SVG\nsupport.\n\nTested that integrations were setting `srcset` correctly.\n\nTested that datagrids were using SVGs when limiting the max density\nlevel to 1 (forcing SVGs for Retina displays).\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/9260/", "tree": {"sha": "591153335c894ec503f5d883623d578ddb31c068", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/591153335c894ec503f5d883623d578ddb31c068"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/38a2d70c6854126045188d713bd77bf4d88864c3", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/38a2d70c6854126045188d713bd77bf4d88864c3", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/38a2d70c6854126045188d713bd77bf4d88864c3", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/38a2d70c6854126045188d713bd77bf4d88864c3/comments", "author": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "c11534ffd2ec01d51908eb61e3bf7f77a288cd5a", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/c11534ffd2ec01d51908eb61e3bf7f77a288cd5a", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/c11534ffd2ec01d51908eb61e3bf7f77a288cd5a"}]}, {"sha": "c11534ffd2ec01d51908eb61e3bf7f77a288cd5a", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-10-18T20:01:24Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-10-18T20:01:24Z"}, "message": "Add support for enabling certain extensions by default.\n\nThis adds a new setting, `settings.EXTENSIONS_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT`, which\nis a list of extension IDs that will be automatically enabled when first\nregistered in the database through `ExtensionManager.load()`.

The deadlock occurred due to Django's `Signal.connect()`\ntriggering a `RelationCounterField` weak reference to drop while\niterating through signal handlers, which resulted in a callback in\n`RelationCounterField` that then attempted to disconnect signals. Since\n`Signal.connect()` already grabbed a lock, `Signal.disconnect()` was\nblocked waiting on that lock, causing the process (whether unit tests or\nweb server) to hang.\n\nIn order to get around this, the state tracking has been changed a bit,\nin a way that actually cleans up the code and brings some consistency\nand order to how unsaved instances work. Previously, unsaved model\ninstances (those with a primary key of None) required listening both for\na save (to begin tracking state) and a weak reference drop (to clean up\nsignal handlers), which required the use of non-weak signal callbacks,\npreventing `Signal` from doing its own cleanup.\n\nIn the new design, `InstanceState` has been updated to be used for both\nsaved and unsaved instances. It now owns the signal handlers, and\nconnects to them using weak references, so that `Signal` can handle\ndisconnecting (in a way that avoids deadlocks) when the state is\nno longer referenced. An `InstanceState` that represents an unsaved\ninstance will listen for when the instance is saved, remove the existing\nreferences to itself, and register new `InstanceStates` for the saved\nreference.\n\n`InstanceState` also listens for when the weak reference is cleared for\nboth saved and unsaved instances, so that the resets always happen when\nneeded. It also no longer listens to `pre_delete` for unsaved instances,\nreducing the number of signal connections.\n\nThis all avoids the problem of nested locks in `Signal`, creates\nconsistency in how all instances are tracked, and further reduces the\nchances of state or signal connection leaks.\n\nTesting Done:\nSet up a reproduceable unit test run in Review Board that consistently\neventually ended up in a deadlock (due to the garbage collector deciding\nto run at some point). After this change, I could not reproduce any\ndeadlocks in the test runs.\n\nAll unit tests for Djblets and Review Board pass.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/9268/", "tree": {"sha": "bba3b9712b35ac264f07829462cdfd3cf74a7976", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/bba3b9712b35ac264f07829462cdfd3cf74a7976"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/ac0a9d098c2ddacca1531a0030a29d38672741af", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/ac0a9d098c2ddacca1531a0030a29d38672741af", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/ac0a9d098c2ddacca1531a0030a29d38672741af", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/ac0a9d098c2ddacca1531a0030a29d38672741af/comments", "author": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "cdb7c636126bd8483ecae3f52f265e3a106378bf", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/cdb7c636126bd8483ecae3f52f265e3a106378bf", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/cdb7c636126bd8483ecae3f52f265e3a106378bf"}]}, {"sha": "cdb7c636126bd8483ecae3f52f265e3a106378bf", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-10-15T20:13:31Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-10-15T20:13:31Z"}, "message": "Split the djblets.util.tests suites into per-suite files.\n\ndjblets.util.tests was getting a bit large, and was only about to grow\nlarger with some upcoming changes.

This only happened if a subclass defined a tests app that\nalready contained a `models.py` file. If it didn't define a specific\ntests app or didn't include a `models.py`, then the cleanup would work\ncorrectly, but if both were present then it would fail.\n\nThe reason for this inconsistency is that if a valid `models.py` didn't\nexist, we'd create one and store a reference to it, which allowed us to\nlater remove it from the module cache. If one already existed, then\nthere wouldn't be a reference, so it never got removed.\n\nThe logic for this is now a bit more careful to explicitly check for a\n`models` module and to store it. If we can't import, we then proceed to\ncreate a module and store that. This ensures we always have a module to\nwork with and to clean up at the end, fixing all tests.\n\nTesting Done:\nAll unit tests pass. Before this change, some failed with unknown app\nerrors involving models from prior test suites.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/9229/", "tree": {"sha": "d0208be31135378ea0bee1fec0c38c2dbab24b37", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/d0208be31135378ea0bee1fec0c38c2dbab24b37"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/96c5e8270451470f0db68ea8aee866c82819eea2", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/96c5e8270451470f0db68ea8aee866c82819eea2", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/96c5e8270451470f0db68ea8aee866c82819eea2", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/96c5e8270451470f0db68ea8aee866c82819eea2/comments", "author": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "2a28c19eaa2d027b21066b57f31b881e352e805f", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/2a28c19eaa2d027b21066b57f31b881e352e805f", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/2a28c19eaa2d027b21066b57f31b881e352e805f"}]}, {"sha": "2a28c19eaa2d027b21066b57f31b881e352e805f", "commit": {"author": {"name": "David Trowbridge", "email": "trowbrds@gmail.com", "date": "2017-09-28T21:43:51Z"}, "committer": {"name": "David Trowbridge", "email": "trowbrds@gmail.com", "date": "2017-09-28T21:43:51Z"}, "message": "Fix up an API rate limit test.\n\nThe first iteration of the change to implement API ratelimiting returned HTTP\n403.

for all API requests.\n\nThis change generalizes the rate limiting infrastructure a bit and adds support\nfor rate limiting API requests. I've changed it so that there are three\nsettings keys, `LOGIN_LIMIT_RATE`, `API_ANONYMOUS_LIMIT_RATE`, and\n`API_AUTHENTICATED_LIMIT_RATE`. These can be set to `None`, which will disable\nrate limiting for that type, or to a rate limit string as before.\n\nIf an API request is rate limited, the response will have the error and include\na couple special headers that show what the limit is and how long the user has\nto wait before retrying the request.\n\nAs part of this, I've also fixed up a couple small issues with the logic\nbetween the different cases depending on the value of `increment`. In the case\nwhere it's `False`, we expect to get results *as if* we were incrementing, but\nwithout actually storing the value to the cache. Once this was fixed, I was\nable to fix `is_ratelimited` to actually check if the limit was exceeded,\nrather than at or above.\n\nBased on work by Raman Dhatt.\n\nTesting done:\n- Manually made some authenticated and anonymous API requests with this\n  configured and saw the expected results.\n- Ran unit tests.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/9114/", "tree": {"sha": "dbca1d328c96a4892451e8b4c8e8ddd7614ced86", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/dbca1d328c96a4892451e8b4c8e8ddd7614ced86"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/d265d9f0679ad4061fb508f7f363abbb967d817e", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/d265d9f0679ad4061fb508f7f363abbb967d817e", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/d265d9f0679ad4061fb508f7f363abbb967d817e", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/d265d9f0679ad4061fb508f7f363abbb967d817e/comments", "author": {"login": "davidt", "id": 2240, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2240?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "davidt", "id": 2240, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2240?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "35118aa4c7ab2a728238fee2f1df1a5bc434a4d5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/35118aa4c7ab2a728238fee2f1df1a5bc434a4d5", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/35118aa4c7ab2a728238fee2f1df1a5bc434a4d5"}]}, {"sha": "35118aa4c7ab2a728238fee2f1df1a5bc434a4d5", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Barret Rennie", "email": "barret@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-08-22T20:27:34Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Barret Rennie", "email": "barret@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-08-22T20:27:34Z"}, "message": "Downgrade ResourceOAuth2TokenMixin error to warning\n\nThe OAuth2 scopes code logs an error if a resource does not inherit fom\nthe OAuth2 token mixin.

LESS to use defined variables for\ncolours. These colours were being used in Review Board's account pages\nand this change will allow the colours to be imported (instead of the\ncurrent hardcoding that occurs).\n\nThe CSS for config forms lists has been slightly tweaked so that they\nhave the same top and bottom border. Previously, there was no bottom\nborder on the list -- it was just the `border-bottom` from the last\nelement in the list, which uses a different colour from the `border-top`\nof the entire list.\n\nAdditionally, support has been added for a new\n`.config-forms-list-empty` element that is intended to be a sibling of\nthe `.config-forms-list`. It will only be shown when the list has n\nchildren. This is a generally useful pattern for supporting\nplaceholders that don't have to be dynamically added and removed from\nthe page. This is a refactor from a pattern I was using in Review\nBoard.\n\nTesting Done:\nTested with an upcoming change for Review Board.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/9074/", "tree": {"sha": "f2cc70be24495c4e824030f6d774094cb3502468", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/f2cc70be24495c4e824030f6d774094cb3502468"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/5d29895103d1fe903f98b991042b382a81935d0f", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/5d29895103d1fe903f98b991042b382a81935d0f", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/5d29895103d1fe903f98b991042b382a81935d0f", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/5d29895103d1fe903f98b991042b382a81935d0f/comments", "author": {"login": "brennie", "id": 156585, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/156585?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie", "html_url": "https://github.com/brennie", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "brennie", "id": 156585, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/156585?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie", "html_url": "https://github.com/brennie", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "4f3a958091c01ebc832e205c1c14ef8311c6f6bc", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/4f3a958091c01ebc832e205c1c14ef8311c6f6bc", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/4f3a958091c01ebc832e205c1c14ef8311c6f6bc"}]}, {"sha": "4f3a958091c01ebc832e205c1c14ef8311c6f6bc", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Barret Rennie", "email": "barret@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-07-20T20:25:44Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Barret Rennie", "email": "barret@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-07-20T20:25:51Z"}, "message": "Add support for OAuth2 in the web API\n\nDjblets now supports OAuth2 authentication in the Web API.

improve styling for links in the datagrids.\n\nOur datagrids were rendering with extra, unwanted `<a>` tags for some\ncolumns. Part of this was due to an old change that regressed the\n`link=False` semantics, causing this flag to just result in `link_func`\nbeing ignored rather than disabling linking. Another part was due to the\nusage of `<div>` within `<a>`, which isn't legal and caused the browser\nto do odd things that easily resulted in duplicate tags. Still another\nwas the need for rendering custom `<a>` tags as part of the cell data\nwhen in need of a custom CSS class (which often resulted in extra tags\ngiven the `link=False` breakage).\n\nNow, `link=False` is respected. When provided, links will not be\ngenerated for the row's object in the data automatically. Similarly, if\n`link_func` fails, the URL won't fall back to the URL for the row's\nobject.\n\nThe `<a>` tags no longer contain a `<div>`. Instead, we just assign\n`display: block` to the `<a>`. The cell also gained a `has-link` CSS\nclass to help with styling, so that there's no impact on custom `<a>`\ntags within the cell.\n\nColumns can now accept a `link_css_class` attribute, which specifies the\nCSS class names (or a function returning them) to apply to the `<a>`,\nreducing the work that a column has to do and reducing the amount of\ndata that must be cached.\n\nThis shouldn't outright break any consumers unless they're using\n`link=False` and still expecting links to show up (which wasn't really\never the intended behavior). However, they can now take advantage of\n`link_css_class` to reduce the data they must render.\n\nTesting Done:\nTested with Review Board, both the current upstream and with a change\nthat takes advantage of the new `link_css_class`.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/9080/", "tree": {"sha": "3a7fcfea1b6f035c143c33b4e3ee6f769477dd6f", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/3a7fcfea1b6f035c143c33b4e3ee6f769477dd6f"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/06741b9006d4fa3c590394d714e4edbfa8a8f203", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/06741b9006d4fa3c590394d714e4edbfa8a8f203", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/06741b9006d4fa3c590394d714e4edbfa8a8f203", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/06741b9006d4fa3c590394d714e4edbfa8a8f203/comments", "author": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "f23379d8c131fbdd202b8ba9d861bdcdfa641329", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/f23379d8c131fbdd202b8ba9d861bdcdfa641329", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/f23379d8c131fbdd202b8ba9d861bdcdfa641329"}]}, {"sha": "f23379d8c131fbdd202b8ba9d861bdcdfa641329", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Barret Rennie", "email": "barret@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-07-17T21:13:19Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Barret Rennie", "email": "barret@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-07-17T21:13:19Z"}, "message": "Support rendering with additional context in Config.ListItemView\n\n`Djblets.Config.ListItemView` now supports an additional method,\n`getRenderContext` that will be used with the associated model's\nattributes to generate the full render context for the template.

view mixins for ETags and finer-grained dispatching.\n\nThere are two new mixins added for generic views: One for working with\nETags, and one for more complex views that need to alter dispatch logic.\n\n`ETagViewMixin` is a mixin that allows for computing an ETag for a generic\nview, checking if the client already has a copy of the content based on\nthat ETag, and setting appropriate headers in the response. This supports\nHTTP GET and HTTP HEAD (but currently no other methods).\n\n`PrePostDispatchViewMixin` is useful for views that want to run logic\nin the dispatch phase but also make use of mixin that add decorators to\n`dispatch()`. Since the view's `dispatch()` would run before the ones\ndecoratored in the mixins, there wasn't a good way to override dispatch\nbehavior (calculating state, checking access permissions, or augmenting\nresponses).\n\nThis mixin solves this by splitting the `dispatch()` method into a\n`pre_dispatch()` and `post_dispatch()`. When placed after mixins adding\ndecorators and before mixins altering `dispatch()` logic, views will be\nable to get custom logic into the dispatch phase.\n\n`pre_dispatch()` can calculate state and optionally return a response to\nsend directly to the client (useful for access checks).\n\n`post_dispatch()` can take a response from the HTTP handler and alter\nit. It can even return a custom response, if needed.\n\nTesting Done:\nUnit tests pass.\n\nTested manually with some new views I'm writing.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/8998/", "tree":

to properly check inherited fields.\n\nThe decorator for defining fields for webapi requests,\n`@webapi_request_fields`, was written to combine properly with\n`@augment_method_from`, allowing fields to be inherited. This can be seen in\nthe documentation for various resources, where the new fields are properly\ncombined with old ones. Unfortunately, the code that actually checks the fields\nat runtime was using the wrong variable, causing it to only look at fields\ndefined in the most top-level method. We didn't notice this until now because\nmost places that use this also pass `allow_unknown=True`. This change fixes up\nthe decorator to check the combined fields lists.\n\nThere's one complication added by the fact that if this decorator is applied\nmultiple times, the \"inner\" decorator doesn't know about the outer fields. I've\nsolved this by adding an assumption that if a field is present in kwargs, that\nwe've already parsed and validated its contents.\n\nTesting done:\n- Reproduced a regression in Review Board 2.5.10 which was caused by the\n  addition of a fields decorator in a subclass that shadowed parameters from\n  the superclass. After this change, I was once again able to use the\n  `max-results` and `start` parameters that had been hidden.\n- Ran unit tests.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/8981/", "tree":

There were also behavioral changes since 2.4 that impacted our\nWYSIWYG rendering.\n\nThe signature for `makeExtension` has changed, and the `safe_mode`\nargument is scheduled for removal. To handle these changes, our\n`makeExtension` functions now accept variable and keyword arguments,\nwhich will work across all versions. To replace the `safe_mode`\nargument, we now have a new `EscapeHTMLExtension`, which makes use of\nPython-Markdown's recommended way of enabling escape mode (with some\nsmall changes to prevent problems when using both the extension and\n`safe_mode` in code that still needs to be migrated).\n\nThe WYSIWYG extension was seeing regressions in newline handling. The\nextension overrides Python-Markdown's postprocessor for replacing\ninternal HTML placeholder markers with stashed HTML (needed by\nextensions and certain Markdown directives) and attempts to prevent\ntrailing newlines from being injected. The implementation of\nPython-Markdown's version changed, breaking the method we used to\noverride the behavior. We now have a re-implementation of this processor\nthat does an even better job of working around the newline issues, and\nis actually faster than the original version.\n\n`Markdown.ESCAPE_CHARS` was also no longer available. It's defined only\nwhen an instance is created, which is a fairly heavy-weight operation\n(for these purposes). Since the list has not changed since it was\nintroduced, it should be safe for us to define this ourselves.\n\n2.7 will also need to now specify the full module path for all\nextensions, including Python-Markdown's built-in extensions. Djblets\nonly specifies extension names in the tests, so this is a simple fix.\n\nWith these changes, clients will be able to use any version of Python\nMarkdown from 2.4 through 2.7, and likely future versions as well.\n\nTesting Done:\nUnit tests ran against Python-Markdown 2.4 (our currently supported\nversion) and 2.6.\n\nTested with my real-world and crazy Markdown tests on Review Board with\nboth versions of Python-Markdown.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/8988/", "tree": {"sha": "aab222be109c0714ba0ba13a6c58cd2c0a627851", "url":

touch event proxying code to better represent mouse events.\n\n`$.fn.proxyTouchEvents()` now simulates mouseover/mouseout events, better\nhelping to make touch events compatible with more pieces of UI (in\nparticular, for the purposes of this change, jQuery-UI's `resizable`\nwidget). It now keeps track of what elements the user has moved their\nfinger over in the calculation of the events.\n\nTouch events are only proxied if using one finger. Gestures are left\nalone so that the page or browser can handle them.\n\nThis does not yet implement the mouseenter/mouseleave events, though,\nwhich are a bit more complicated to get right.\n\nTesting Done:\nTested with Review Board's comment dialog, which utilizes the `resizable`\nwidget. Saw that I was able to drag the handle around, verifying that the\nmouseover/mouseout events were working.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/8932/", "tree": {"sha": "7e7819ee719ed656e97cfa9ad95abf23d29097f2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/7e7819ee719ed656e97cfa9ad95abf23d29097f2"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/2a212426ac73af4b83b82594f0ef4748bada78be", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/2a212426ac73af4b83b82594f0ef4748bada78be", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/2a212426ac73af4b83b82594f0ef4748bada78be", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/2a212426ac73af4b83b82594f0ef4748bada78be/comments", "author": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "56b2b4e2c63b81fd0daaa321163a18a76b082f73", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/56b2b4e2c63b81fd0daaa321163a18a76b082f73", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/56b2b4e2c63b81fd0daaa321163a18a76b082f73"}]}, {"sha": "56b2b4e2c63b81fd0daaa321163a18a76b082f73", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-05-10T09:08:49Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-05-10T09:12:44Z"}, "message": "Capture and report errors when extension media installation fails.\n\nIt's possible (and not very hard) to get into situations where extension\nmedia installation fails.

performance issue with datagrids using chained select_related calls.\n\nDatagrids allow columns to augment the queryset, pulling in additional\nfields if needed. While we've generally gotten away with this, it\ndoesn't really work well in practice on Django 1.6, because calls to\n`select_related()` do not chain. They've fixed this on newer versions of\nDjango, but we can't depend on those for this.\n\nThe good news is that they can be made to be chainable by merging the\nselect_related dictionaries on querysets. This format is standard on all\nversions of Django 1.6 and higher.\n\nThis change introduces a `chainable_select_related_queryset` function that\ntakes in a `QuerySet` and returns a version supporting chaining. On Django\n1.6, this returns a special subclass that handles merging. On newer\nversions, this simply returns the provided `QuerySet`.\n\nDatagrids make use of this to ensure that all `select_related()` calls\nfrom queryset augmentation will stay performant and

User.get_profile is removed by @ensure_user_profile\n\nThe `@ensure_user_profile` decorator ensures that `User.get_profile`\nexists because it has been removed in Django 1.7+. For compatability,\nsome unit tests require it to exist (i.e., be on Django 1.6 or have it\nadded by a third party).\n\nOne issue is that when using this in conjunction with KGB to replace the\ndefinition of `get_profile` that the profile will not be deleted, as\n`SpyAgency.tear_down` will execute after `require_user_profile` has\nfinished, which results in the original method not being deleted.\nFurthermore, the mock method we add will stick around as\n`SpyAgency.tear_down` restores it.\n\nTo combat this issue, we now check to see if the function has been\nreplaced by a `FunctionSpy` and unspy on it if that is the case. That\nwill result in `SpyAgency` not modifying the `User` object during\n`tear_down`.\n\nAdditionally, we were comparing `User.get_profile` to our mock method,\nwhich will never be equal because `User.get_profile` will be an unbound\nmethod and not the original function. We now compare to the underlying\nfunction instead.\n\nTesting done:\nRan unit tests on Django 1.6 and 1.8.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/8869/", "tree": {"sha":

text/plain mimetype hack from WebAPIResponse.\n\nOnce upon a time, for uploading file attachments and diffs to Review Board, we\nwould make a request to the API by sticking a form into an iframe and\nsubmitting it. This required an ugly hack on the API side to return the\nresulting response with a text/plain mimetype, so that the browser wouldn't\nsuggest downloading the response. This was extra confusing because the comment\nwith this code was incorrect, leading one to believe that XMLHttpRequest was\nthe problem rather than submitting HTML forms.\n\nHaving this fallback isn't too much of a problem for most cases, but it was\nbreaking the response parsing in the RBTools Python API. We've long since\nreplaced this with code that uses XMLHttpRequest, and so we can get rid of this\nkludge and return the correct mimetype.\n\nTesting done:\n- Sent a file using the RBTools Python API and saw that the response was parsed\n  correctly as an `ItemResource`.\n- Uploaded file attachments via the \"Update > Add File\" form, drag-and-drop,\n  and `rbt attach`.\n- Uploaded diffs via \"Update > Update Diff\" and `rbt post`.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/8807/", "tree": {"sha": "efa172883e0395a0a85801ee681c45d26e070c8d", "url":

Now the API URL is looked up in\nthe template and passed to the JavaScript, which handles it through\nnormal Backbone means.\n\nThis ends up fixing these pages on Review Board and on default Django\ninstalls, and will help with future administration UI styling work.\n\nTesting Done:\nTested the extension and integration pages on Review Board and on a\nplain Django administration UI.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/8791/", "tree": {"sha": "01d2aa63c0284564556aa6a1e806e4d122e330b0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/01d2aa63c0284564556aa6a1e806e4d122e330b0"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/ed2e19437222d836c97a5fffc225ffd353206af5", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/ed2e19437222d836c97a5fffc225ffd353206af5", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/ed2e19437222d836c97a5fffc225ffd353206af5", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/ed2e19437222d836c97a5fffc225ffd353206af5/comments", "author": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "ca522af5015a3fbb68cbeab72c71482bcdbffc14", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/ca522af5015a3fbb68cbeab72c71482bcdbffc14", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/ca522af5015a3fbb68cbeab72c71482bcdbffc14"}]}, {"sha": "ca522af5015a3fbb68cbeab72c71482bcdbffc14", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-03-06T22:48:27Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-03-06T22:48:27Z"}, "message": "Make our administration templates/scripts work on default Django setups.\n\nMuch of Djblets's administration widgets and template code was based on\ncode we had in Review Board. For many many years, Review Board had a\nheavily customized administration interface, and we've been testing\nagainst this. Unfortunately, the code we had in Djblets didn't quite\nwork right in a default Django install. There were style problems,\nscript problems, and blocks that had to be specially defined in a base\ntemplate in order for pages to work.\n\nThis change is the first step to addressing that and making our code\nwork in both Review Board and standard Django setups.\n\nA new base template, djblets_forms/admin/base_site.html, has been added.\nThis is now used in our templates instead of admin/base_site.html, and\nis built to give us a few new blocks to work with: `admin_css`,\n`admin_scripts`, and `admin_scripts_post`. These replace the old `css`,\n`scripts`, and `scripts-post` blocks that were defined in Review Board.\nThese new blocks are guaranteed to be available to any child templates\non a standard Django install. Applications like Review Board will get\nthem for free as long as they don't override the parent blocks or if\nthey specially declare the new blocks themselves in a base template.\n\nThe template for custom change forms now has support for a top-level\n\"media\" variable, like the standard template. It doesn't require a\nversion on the form anymore. Some other changes are coming soon to this\ntemplate.\n\nThe scripts we inject into the page that for integration operations and\nthe conditions field are now compatible with the version of jQuery that\nDjango supplies in the administration page. If a custom version of\njQuery is injected into the page, that will take precedence.\n\nThe djblets-forms JavaScript package no longer requires other Djblets\nJavaScript packages to be loaded. It was previously depending on a\npre-existing `window.Djblets` variable, but it now defines this if not\nfound, like other packages do.\n\nWith these changes, most of our code working with the administration UI\nis now compatible out of the box on any new Django project. Some work is\nstill required to fix up assumptions and bad styling in the extension\nand integration pages, which will be coming in an upcoming change.\n\nTesting Done:\nTested that the settings forms, integration list, integration\nconfiguration, extension list, extension configuration, and log\nviewer pages loaded and worked on Review Board, and mostly worked on\na plain Django admin UI (some work is needed here, which will be done\nseparately).\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/8790/", "tree": {"sha": "d99e72f01af1286832f61e408545b997dc46ad47", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/d99e72f01af1286832f61e408545b997dc46ad47"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/ca522af5015a3fbb68cbeab72c71482bcdbffc14", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/ca522af5015a3fbb68cbeab72c71482bcdbffc14", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/ca522af5015a3fbb68cbeab72c71482bcdbffc14", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/ca522af5015a3fbb68cbeab72c71482bcdbffc14/comments", "author": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "f1f54e79db599024777a232585da0955e3e5a347", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/f1f54e79db599024777a232585da0955e3e5a347", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/f1f54e79db599024777a232585da0955e3e5a347"}]}, {"sha": "f1f54e79db599024777a232585da0955e3e5a347", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-03-06T22:32:51Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-03-06T22:32:51Z"}, "message": "Don't attempt to unregister integrations after shutting down.\n\nWhen a process terminates, both the extension managers and integration\nmanagers are shut down, clearing all state.

Unit\ntests have been updated to check that the resulting state is correct.\n\nTesting Done:\nUnit tests pass.\n\nNo longer saw a SQL query for configurations for every HTTP request.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/8780/", "tree": {"sha": "bcdc2b2494314353979720528c2e8c2766c28630", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/bcdc2b2494314353979720528c2e8c2766c28630"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/d56d48e22d61d243b11a82c21c4d5613653c3a08", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/d56d48e22d61d243b11a82c21c4d5613653c3a08", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/d56d48e22d61d243b11a82c21c4d5613653c3a08", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/d56d48e22d61d243b11a82c21c4d5613653c3a08/comments", "author": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "5b50b843a36fb44504f7fb22c8ccd85ce684e333", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/5b50b843a36fb44504f7fb22c8ccd85ce684e333", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/5b50b843a36fb44504f7fb22c8ccd85ce684e333"}]}, {"sha": "5b50b843a36fb44504f7fb22c8ccd85ce684e333", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-03-06T22:30:57Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-03-06T22:30:57Z"}, "message": "Fix looking up static media needed for Condition value fields.\n\n`ConditionsWidget.media` attempted to look up media files needed for all\nwidgets that comprised the input for the conditions.

for request= keyword arguments for logging statements.\n\nFor a long time now, Djblets has provided support for providing a Django\nHTTP request to logging statements through a `request=` keyword argument.\nThis has generally worked, but some users have encountered somewhat\nsporadic problems with this. This turns out to be related to our move to\nusing `logging.exception()` instead of `logging.error(..., exc_info=True)`\nin places.\n\n`logging.exception()` was missing support for keyword arguments on\nPython 2.6.x, 2.7.0-2.7.5, 3.0.x, and 3.1.x. 2.7.6+ and 3.2.x+ fixed\nthis, but anyone running an older version would not be able to use\n`request=` or even `extra=`.\n\nAlong with this, any custom loggers from `logging.getLogger('...')`\nwould fail to support `request=`, because we only patched up the root\nlogger.\n\nThis change fixes these issues by patching any versions of\n`logging.exception()` that are missing keyword argument support, and\nwrapping `logging.Logger` so all loggers will benefit from `request=`.\n\nTesting Done:\nUnit tests passed on Python 2.6 and 2.7. Previously, these new tests\nfailed on 2.6.\n\nSanity-checked that exception logs (and others) worked with `request=`.\n\nBugs closed: 4523\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/8750/",

extensions code to be compatible with Django 1.6 and higher.\n\nThe extensions code, for many reasons, was not compatible with newer\nversions of Django.

This didn't manifest as an obvious\nproblem on Django 1.6 (though it likely did result in apps not being\nproperly removed when an extension was disabled), but it was a major\nproblem on newer versions (which track apps and state more closely).\nThis code has been cleaned up and ordering has been fixed.\n\nModels weren't being properly cleared from caches before, which wasn't a\nbig problem in practice but could in theory lead to\nintrospection-related problems. These caches are now properly cleared,\nwhere possible.\n\nWe also now call the evolve command from Django Evolution more\ncorrectly, ensuring compatibility not just with various versions of\nDjango but also with changes to the evolve command and its argument\nlist.\n\nUnit tests have been added to check for all the cache-related changes,\nmodel synchronization, and evolution operations.\n\nTesting Done:\nUnit tests pass on Django 1.6 and 1.8 through 1.10.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/8707/", "tree": {"sha": "b958744a18526006a3b8893d18c7679ffaee842e", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/b958744a18526006a3b8893d18c7679ffaee842e"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/94a5793562ca29d0fa2201bf6c47e017e196fef0", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/94a5793562ca29d0fa2201bf6c47e017e196fef0", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/94a5793562ca29d0fa2201bf6c47e017e196fef0", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/94a5793562ca29d0fa2201bf6c47e017e196fef0/comments", "author": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "chipx86", "id": 4063, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86", "html_url": "https://github.com/chipx86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chipx86/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "fdb325c9468a8cf91ae94e2d55285dcf3f28f893", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/fdb325c9468a8cf91ae94e2d55285dcf3f28f893", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/fdb325c9468a8cf91ae94e2d55285dcf3f28f893"}]}, {"sha": "fdb325c9468a8cf91ae94e2d55285dcf3f28f893", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-02-06T21:24:34Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Christian Hammond", "email": "christian@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2017-02-06T21:24:34Z"}, "message": "Add utility functions for clearing template-related caches.\n\nThis adds some useful functions for clearing the template caches in the\nloaders and the template tag library caches.

Djblets.\n\nThe way we do a lot of multi-line templates in JavaScript code is pretty ugly,\nbuilding a big list of strings and then joining them. ES6 template strings are\na potential solution, but they introduce a lot of ugly whitespace if there's\nany indentation in them.\n\nThis change adds babel-plugin-dedent to our build, which adds a preprocessing\nstep that removes leading indentation from template strings which are marked\nwith the `dedent` tag. This looks like an ordinary tag, but it's processed\nduring the compilation step instead of at runtime.\n\nTesting done:\n- Ran `setup.py develop` and saw babel-plugin-dedent get installed correctly.\n- Used the dedent tag in extension code.\n\nReviewed at https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/8535/", "tree": {"sha": "7f9e365ccaea2227b62d7f30f930c4c8e6b48533", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/trees/7f9e365ccaea2227b62d7f30f930c4c8e6b48533"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/git/commits/276c481af80473f1305f7fcc0d2c12ecb5ded7a3", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/276c481af80473f1305f7fcc0d2c12ecb5ded7a3", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/276c481af80473f1305f7fcc0d2c12ecb5ded7a3", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/276c481af80473f1305f7fcc0d2c12ecb5ded7a3/comments", "author": {"login": "davidt", "id": 2240, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2240?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "davidt", "id": 2240, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2240?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidt/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "0342dde960288d3c24894116d0cd92440de77fa0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/commits/0342dde960288d3c24894116d0cd92440de77fa0", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/commit/0342dde960288d3c24894116d0cd92440de77fa0"}]}, {"sha": "0342dde960288d3c24894116d0cd92440de77fa0", "commit": {"author": {"name": "Barret Rennie", "email": "barret@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2016-11-09T23:01:15Z"}, "committer": {"name": "Barret Rennie", "email": "barret@beanbaginc.com", "date": "2016-11-09T23:08:11Z"}, "message": "Refactor the DummyAvatarService into two services\n\nThe `DummyAvatarService` no longer does magic to set whether or not it\nshould provide high DPI avatars.

Djblets 0.6 and the equivalent versions of Review Board (our product that is in production use at small businesses and enterprises world-wide) support Python 2.4 and higher. We have company that run these older versions of Review Board on very specific software stacks, and occasionally need to migrate to bigger systems, performing a new install.\n\nIf we were to change the dependency from PIL to pillowfight for Djblets 0.6.x, we would be breaking these production installs the second they went to do this. pillowfight would install, and it would favor Pillow on the replacement server (as it's unlikely PIL would be installed there yet). That would then fail, due to the Python version compatibility difference.\n\nThere are also subtle differences between PIL and Python compatibility for some modules made back in the day, which would be running on these systems. PIL could have been installed in two ways. One way introduces a top-level Image namespace, and the other way does not. Modules sometimes chose one way or the other for importing (we've hit this issue before on some systems). That means that, once again, we'd be introducing a possible breakage to production installations.\n\nWe have an obligation to keep older production versions of Review Board and Djblets from breaking, as our users are used to a level of stability there. We will not be changing dependencies on the 0.6.x branch. That's considered frozen.\n\nAs David mentioned, 0.7.x and 0.8.x is intended to be used with newer versions of Django. We'd recommend upgrading.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/issues/comments/93520710/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/issues/comments/189475179", "html_url": "https://github.com/djblets/djblets/pull/16#issuecomment-189475179", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/djblets/djblets/issues/16", "id": 189475179, "user": {"login": "brennie", "id": 156585, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/156585?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie", "html_url": "https://github.com/brennie", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brennie/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2016-02-26T20:39:42Z", "updated_at": "2016-02-26T20:39:42Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "We do not accept pull requests.
