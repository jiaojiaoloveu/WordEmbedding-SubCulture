This is not a problem with non-NFS mounts and it is only a problem if you attempt to delete the folder in which the open file handler is using.\r\n\r\n**File download example use case:**\r\n* Create a temporary directory on the NFS mount.\r\n* Use `\\Aws\\S3\\S3Client::getObject` to download an object *that does not exist in S3*.  Set `SaveAs` to a file path within the temporary directory on the NFS mount.\r\n* Delete the temporary directory by iterating files and deleting each one.  Once the directory is empty, remove the directory.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*: instead of passing in a file path into `SaveAs`, pass in the file `resource` handler itself and ensure it is closed after calling `\\Aws\\S3\\S3Client::getObject`.\r\n\r\n**Multipart upload example use case:**\r\n* Create a temporary directory on the NFS mount.\r\n* Use `\\Aws\\S3\\S3ClientTrait::upload` to upload a large file which would trigger multipart upload (16Mb or larger).\r\n* Delete the temporary directory by iterating files and deleting each one.  Once the directory is empty, remove the directory.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*: None found, need to avoid using multipart uploads by using `\\Aws\\S3\\S3Client::putObject`.\r\n\r\n**Example error:**\r\nBoth of the above use cases result in an error that looks like this:\r\n> Warning: unlink(/path/to/directory/being/deleted/.nfs676dc60d2899deb8000000c5): Device or resource busy in /path/to/script.php on line X\r\n\r\nSome info about the `.nfs` files, http://nfs.sourceforge.net/#faq_d2\r\n\r\n**Solutions:**\r\n* Update the SDK to close these?\r\n* Is it possible for me to add middleware or listen to some events to automatically close these?\r\n* Others? Open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nCheers and thanks for the help.

"closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "body": "The multipart uploader does some 'special' handling of streams I'd like to discuss.\n\nStreams are only treated as seekable if the underlying resource is a filehandle (\"wrapper_type = plainfile\", see [AbstractUploader::getUploadCommands()](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/blob/master/src/Multipart/AbstractUploader.php#L46)). In the MultipartUploader implementations for S3 and Glacier there is even access to the underlying url and a new stream is created opening the file for each part, bypassing the original stream (see [MultipartUploader::createPart()](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/blob/master/src/S3/MultipartUploader.php#L90)).\n\nAs a result, all streams that don't have an underlying file are first copied into a new stream backed by \"php://temp\". That means they are written into a temporary file in a location provided by sys_get_temp_dir(). PHP writes the data to disk if the size is larger than 2 MB which is the case for every but maybe the last part of a multipart upload.\n\nThis all brings (a) latency because of copying data to disk, (b) additional space requirements on disk, (c) additional open filehandles and (d) the risk of the disk running full. This is done even if the stream is declared as seekable by it's implementation. And in case of an error and restarting the uploader all this buffering is repeated for parts that are still to be transmitted.\n\nIs there a reason for doing this and depending on the underlying source of a stream? Shouldn't it be the responsibility of the stream's implementation to handle all that?\n\nThe only reason I can think of is that multiple streams all have their own seek position and don't interfere with other consumers of the underlying file in an async program execution context. But shouldn't it be sufficient to call seek() before reading from the stream to make sure it is back in the right position? I am not aware of current multithreading features in other php implementations (HHVM, etc) but at least in plain old PHP I have no situation in mind where a seek() directly followed by a read() in the same \"unit of work\" should be disturbed by other code re-seeking the stream.\n\nFor non-seekable streams I can see that this buffering is necessary because the parts are uploaded concurrently. But if the source stream is seekable I don't think all this is needed.\n\nIn my case (and the reason I am writing all this) I have a seekable stream implementation that handles reading parts of a large file from multiple third-party API calls. Providing that stream to the multipart uploader first buffers the parts on disk which has the high risk of the disk running full in case of multiple concurrent requests in my application. This leaves me with either implementing multipart uploads using the low-level API myself or creating a stream wrapper for my stream implementation faking to be a \"plainfile\".\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1101/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081", "id": 175738215, "number": 1081, "title": "Using the SDK for CloudSearch is a pain", "user": {"login": "assembledadam", "id": 729240, "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/729240?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam", "html_url": "https://github.com/assembledadam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 19969646, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/labels/feature-request", "name": "feature-request", "color": "009800", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2016-09-08T12:15:18Z", "updated_at": "2016-09-09T18:52:38Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "body": "A snippet from a call like this:\n\n```\n$cloudSearchClient->search([\n    'query' => \"(phrase field=_id 'some-permalink')\",\n    'queryParser' => 'structured',\n])->get('hits');\n```\n\nGives me this result:\n\n```\narray:2 [\n  \"id\" => \"some-permalink\"\n  \"fields\" => array:10 [\n    \"category\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"screenshots\"\n    ]\n    \"permalink\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"some-permalink\"\n    ]\n    \"date\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"2016-06-21T11:25:22Z\"\n    ]\n    \"site_permalink\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"videogamer\"\n    ]\n    \"created_at\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"2016-06-21T11:24:40Z\"\n    ]\n    \"subtype\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"images\"\n    ]\n    \"keywords\" => array:2 [\n      0 => \"dead by daylight\"\n      1 => \"pc\"\n    ]\n    \"name_en\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"Dead by Daylight Screenshots\"\n    ]\n    \"type\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"content\"\n    ]\n    \"body_en\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"Check out these screenshots from Dead by Daylight\"\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n```\n\nWhy on earth is every result field an array?

Or in a years time when some is using 3.0?\n> \n> You can't (and shouldn't) have to guarantee perfect backwards-compatibility between all future versions.\n\nThe SDK should be viewed as a complete set by itself. Once SDK 2.x has complete support for all services, you should plan to migrate fully, and all of the 2.x code in your project should all come from the same version of the SDK.\n\nSDK 1.x started life in 2005 as a third-party open-source project called Tarzan. That codebase lasted for 7 years, and we expect that the code that we've recently shipped should last us another several years \u2014 even if we eventually version it as 3.0, 4.0, etc.\n\nThe reason why this particular change is so impactful is because of the changes that occurred in the PHP language when 5.3 came out. Switching to namespaces forced us to break everything. From the changes we've seen in 5.4 and in previews of 5.5, we don't see changes of this magnitude having to happen again for a long time.\n\n> What strategy should I use for using SDKs 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, etc all in the same PHP context side-by-side? Is there anything that can be done upstream (by you) to help?\n\nYou shouldn't. Any SDK code that you use should all be the same version of 1.x or all the same version of 2.x (and possibly 3.x and 4.x). Again, it took us 7 years before we had to go back and do a ground-up rewrite of the code.\n\nInstead of thinking in terms of version numbers, think in terms of generations.\n\n**First Generation:**\n- Tarzan 1.0 (2005)\n- Tarzan 1.1 (2005)\n- Tarzan 2.0 (2008)\n- CloudFusion 2.5 (2010; renamed)\n- AWS SDK for PHP 1.0 (2010; renamed; formerly CloudFusion 3.0)\n- ...\n- AWS SDK for PHP 1.5.15 (2012; equivalent to CloudFusion 3.5.15)\n\n**Second Generation:**\n- AWS SDK for PHP 2.0 (2012; equivalent to Guzzle-based SDK for AWS 1.0)\n- ...\n\nWe currently provide compatibility for jumping between _generations_ of SDK. You should use all the same version of one generation alongside all the same version of the other generation. Even though this _appears_ to be a jump from 1.x to 2.x, you shouldn't necessarily expect the same kinds of changes from our eventual 3.0.\n\nIt would be reasonable to suggest that a future 3.0 release might leverage Traits (new in PHP 5.4; not compatible with 5.3). In this case, _some_ changes might be required, but we anticipate them being _adjustments_ to the existing SDK 2.0 API, instead of being a wholesale rewrite that we're presently experiencing with the move from the older Tarzan/CloudFusion codebase to the new Guzzle-based codebase.\n\nAny time we've been forced to release a breaking change, we've made it a point to call it out **very specifically** in our release notes, change log, API reference documentation, and other update-related documentation. On the off-chance that a minor breaking change has to be made, we will continue to thoroughly document those changes in the places that we think people will look (it's _always_ a good idea to read release notes before upgrading, but we know that some customers don't).\n\nIf you're using Composer to install either SDK (definitely a best practice, and the de-facto successor to PEAR/Pyrus), it would be wise to scope updates down to minor releases (e.g., 1.5._, 2.0._) to make sure that you don't jump up to a new major version (e.g., 1._, 2._) without knowing it (whereas I'm defining version numbers as `<architecture>.<major>.<minor>`, like the Linux kernel, Mac OS X, and Firefox releases before 4.0).\n\nMake sense? :)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/10178857/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/10208466", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/5#issuecomment-10208466", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/5", "id": 10208466, "user": {"login": "ashishtilara", "id": 1509613, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1509613?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara", "html_url": "https://github.com/ashishtilara", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2012-11-08T22:47:32Z", "updated_at": "2012-11-08T22:47:32Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "@skyzyx Pardon my frustration, but this doesn't really answer my concerns.

My JavaScript function to instantiate Uploadify looks like this:\n\n``` js\n$('#file_upload').uploadify({\n    'buttonClass': 'button',\n    'buttonText': 'Upload',\n    'formData': <?php echo json_encode($formInputs); ?>,\n    'fileObjName': 'file',\n    'fileTypeExts': '*.mp3',\n    'height': 36,\n    'multi': false,\n    'onUploadError': function(file, errorCode, errorMsg, errorString) {\n        console.log('onUploadError', file, errorCode, errorMsg, errorString);\n    },\n    'onUploadSuccess': function(file, data, response) {\n        console.log('onUploadSuccess', file, data, response);\n    },\n    'swf': '/assets/site/swf/uploadify.swf',\n    'uploader': '<?php echo $uploadPath; ?>',\n    'width': 120\n});\n```\n\nThe content of my success page is logged in the console as the `data` argument, but I\u2019d like to actually _redirect_ to that page, rather than having the response available to me in JavaScript. Is this an issue with Flash, JavaScript, Uploadify, what?\n\nFinally, how can I enforce that only files with an **.mp3** extension are uploaded?\n", "reactions": {"url":

If I were doing it manually, I would probably read off of a file handler like @jsor was doing in the original post on this ticket.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/10671851/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/10704879", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/17#issuecomment-10704879", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/17", "id": 10704879, "user": {"login": "jeremeamia", "id": 107867, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/107867?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremeamia", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2012-11-26T05:11:02Z", "updated_at": "2012-11-26T05:11:02Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "@isleshocky77 Did there end up being a problem, or was it just a typo?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/10704879/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/10749588", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/17#issuecomment-10749588", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/17", "id": 10749588, "user": {"login": "isleshocky77", "id": 361586, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/361586?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/isleshocky77", "html_url": "https://github.com/isleshocky77", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/isleshocky77/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/isleshocky77/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/isleshocky77/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/isleshocky77/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/isleshocky77/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/isleshocky77/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/isleshocky77/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/isleshocky77/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/isleshocky77/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2012-11-27T08:25:08Z", "updated_at": "2012-11-27T08:25:08Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Yeah.

For example, if you wanted to add in some event listeners to help with debugging you could do something like the following.\n\n``` php\n// Create a transfer object from the builder\n// ... (See the preceding code sample for this portion)\n\n// Attach event listeners to the transfer object for debugging purposes\n$dispatcher = $transfer->getEventDispatcher();\n$dispatcher->addListener($transfer::BEFORE_UPLOAD, function ($event) {\n    echo \"About to start uploading parts.\\n\";\n});\n$dispatcher->addListener($transfer::AFTER_UPLOAD, function ($event) {\n    echo \"Finished uploading parts.\\n\";\n});\n$dispatcher->addListener($transfer::BEFORE_PART_UPLOAD, function ($event) {\n    $partNumber = $event['command']->get('PartNumber');\n    $size = $event['command']->get('Body')->getContentLength();\n    echo \"About to upload part {$partNumber}, which is {$size} bytes.\\n\";\n});\n$dispatcher->addListener($transfer::AFTER_PART_UPLOAD, function ($event) {\n    $partNumber = $event['command']->get('PartNumber');\n    $eTag = $event['command']->getResult()->get('ETag');\n    echo \"Finished uploading part {$partNumber}, which has an ETag of {$eTag}.\\n\";\n});\n$dispatcher->addListener($transfer::AFTER_COMPLETE, function ($event) {\n    echo \"Upload completed.\\n\";\n});\n$dispatcher->addListener($transfer::AFTER_ABORT, function ($event) {\n    echo \"Upload aborted.\\n\";\n});\n\n// Perform the upload\n// ... (See the preceding code sample for this portion)\n```\n\nYou can add additional parameters like ACL and content-type to the upload by using the `UploadBuilder::setHeaders()` method and the appropriate header keys. We plan on adding additional helper methods to make adding this data easier, but it _is_ currently possible.

If you do not have APC enabled, we recommend that you do that to ensure the best performance for the session handler. You should also set the `apc.shm_size` ini setting to at least 64MB. This allows various parts of the client instantiation process to be cached, including loading the service description. We saw that session handler in version 2 of the SDK performs close to twice as fast than in version 1 under these conditions.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/11112676/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/11114765", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/19#issuecomment-11114765", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/19", "id": 11114765, "user": {"login": "jeremeamia", "id": 107867, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/107867?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremeamia", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2012-12-07T01:35:24Z", "updated_at": "2012-12-07T01:35:24Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "Not entirely sure based on this information.

If that doesn't work, then I can look into it more.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/11115203/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/11126965", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/19#issuecomment-11126965", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/19", "id": 11126965, "user": {"login": "romainneutron", "id": 137574, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/137574?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/romainneutron", "html_url": "https://github.com/romainneutron", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romainneutron/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romainneutron/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romainneutron/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romainneutron/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romainneutron/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romainneutron/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romainneutron/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romainneutron/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romainneutron/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2012-12-07T11:35:39Z", "updated_at": "2012-12-07T11:35:57Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "I confirm that it solved this issue !\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/11126965/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/11127965", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/14#issuecomment-11127965", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/14", "id": 11127965, "user": {"login": "etiennea", "id": 1151237, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1151237?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/etiennea", "html_url": "https://github.com/etiennea", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/etiennea/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/etiennea/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/etiennea/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/etiennea/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/etiennea/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/etiennea/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/etiennea/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/etiennea/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/etiennea/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2012-12-07T12:18:16Z", "updated_at": "2012-12-07T12:18:16Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "The setting is already 64mb and apc is enabled in phpinfo() do I have to do anything special to enable it for the sdk 2 in the old sdk i had set 'default_cache_config' => 'apc' ?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/11127965/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/11135739", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/19#issuecomment-11135739", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/19", "id": 11135739, "user": {"login": "jeremeamia", "id": 107867, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/107867?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremeamia", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2012-12-07T16:17:56Z", "updated_at": "2012-12-07T16:17:56Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "Great, I thought it would.

The problem is that, for some reason, the request is being resent internally inside of cURL. This could be caused by some sort of intermittent networking issue. When cURL needs to resend data that is previously sent, it attempts to rewind the data stream. Unfortunately, PHP does not allow a custom seek or ioctl function to be passed to cURL, so when cURL attempts to rewind our custom stream, it fails. Here's the related issue on PHP.net-- I would be grateful if you upvoted this issue: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47204\n\nI've disabled the use of streaming requests when interacting with JSON services like Amazon DynamoDB. This will prevent cURL error 65 from occurring because cURL is able to rewind a string of POST data internally.

You can add an abstraction layer over the client and mock your abstraction layer. Alternatively, you could add a `Guzzle\\Plugin\\Mock\\MockPlugin` to the client and queue up an array of HTTP responses with the plugin: http://guzzlephp.org/guide/plugins.html#mock-plugin.

Thank you! The logic all seems to be in place and you have some nice serparation of concerns. I do have some suggestions though, so bare with me. First, There are definitely some names I want to change. Second, I see what you did with the strategies, which is good, but I think it might be better to organize it a little differently, which will also make the whole thing eaiser to test as well.\n\nCurrently, you have a setup like this (disregarding the exceptions)\n- `Aws\\Sns\\Validator\\SnsValidator`\n- `Aws\\Sns\\Validator\\Strategy\\StrategyInterface`\n- `Aws\\Sns\\Validator\\Strategy\\NotificationStrategy`\n- `Aws\\Sns\\Validator\\Strategy\\SubscriptionConfirmationStrategy`\n\nAnd you are using `stdClass` to pass around the message data.\n\nI think it would make more sense to have message classes that encapsulate the data and creates the strings to sign. I would prefer a structure like this:\n- `Aws\\Sns\\MessageValidator\\MessageInterface`\n- `Aws\\Sns\\MessageValidator\\AbstractMessage`\n- `Aws\\Sns\\MessageValidator\\NotificationMessage`\n- `Aws\\Sns\\MessageValidator\\SubscriptionConfirmationMessage`\n- `Aws\\Sns\\MessageValidator\\MessageValidator`\n\nBasically the `AbstractMessage` would contain the factory logic for creating the concrete message classes, include common logic like getting the data, and defining an abstract `getStringToSign()` function. This function would be the same as the `buildSignatureBody` method of your strategy classes but would be defined in the concrete message classes instead. I'd prefer the method to be named `getStringToSign()` because we typical use the term \"string to sign\" when we're dealing with the other signature classes in the SDK.\n\nSince all of the message and message factory logic will be in the Message objects, you can update your validator object to be a stateless object that basically only has one method: `validate()`. The constructor should still check for the presence of openssl, and all of the openssl calls should be in that class only, like you have it now.\n\nThe benefit of this new setup is that it is much easier to unit test. The message class is very straight forward to test, and the only tricky stuff would be in the validator. We would gain the ability to mock the Message object though, which could help with testing the validator. It's also not a difficult change since it is mainly just moving existing code around.\n\nAs far as usage goes, it would like only a little different from what you showed me yesterday. This is what I would picture:\n\n``` php\n<?php\nuse Aws\\Sns\\Model\\MessageValidator\\AbstractMessage;\nuse Aws\\Sns\\Model\\MessageValidator\\MessageValidator;\n\n$message = AbstractMessage::fromArray(json_decode($HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA, true));\n$validator = new MessageValidator();\nif ($validator->validate($message)) {\n    echo 'Yay! The message came from AWS.';\n} else {\n    echo 'Uh oh. The message may NOT have come from AWS.'\n}\n```\n\nSo again, thank you so much for doing this! I'd love to see my suggestions incorporated into your code if you have time. If not, I totally understand, and I can take what you've done and work on it myself. As I see it, you've done the hard part for me already. Just let me know what you feel like doing and if your up to doing a little more work.\n\nI do need you to sign a CLA for me though. Please send an email to the email address I have listed on my GitHub profile, and I'll prepare that for you.

When you do `$s3 = S3Client::factory();` It creates the default credentials object which is a `RefreshableInstanceProfileCredentials` object. Even though you've set explicit credentials, an expiration has not been set, so the `RefreshableInstanceProfileCredentials` considers the credentials as expired. Because of this, it tries to refresh the credentials by looking for an Instance Profile in your environment, which is only something available on a configured EC2 instance.\n\nSo, to get around this limitation right now you can add `$credentials->setExpiration(null)` like this:\n\n``` php\n$s3 = S3Client::factory();\n\n$credentials = $s3->getCredentials();\n$credentials->setAccessKeyId('key');\n$credentials->setSecretKey('secret');\n$credentials->setExpiration(null);\n```\n\nThat should tell the `RefreshableInstanceProfileCredentials` object that your credentials don't expire. You should only have to so that once regardless of how many times the credentials are modified.\n\nHowever, it does show that having a public `setCredentials` method would be handy so that you don't have to worry about refreshable credentials, if you don't need them. Then, in the future you could do:\n\n``` php\n$s3 = S3Client::factory();\n$s3->setCredentials(new Credentials('<key>', '<secret>'));\n```\n\nWe will add this feature and updating the docs to our TODO list.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/14806821/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/14815600", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/pull/53#issuecomment-14815600", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/53", "id": 14815600, "user": {"login": "jeremeamia", "id": 107867, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/107867?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremeamia", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2013-03-13T00:52:15Z", "updated_at": "2013-03-13T00:52:15Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "I created a branch on the repository called [`feature-snsmsg`](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/tree/feature-snsmsg) with all of our changes so far.

It might be better to use the [FileInfo](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.fileinfo.php) so file extensions aren't needed.\n\nSo perhaps a feature similar to this, or maybe the ability to add a callback function to the stream context options which can inspect and modify the parameters before an object is written would be nice.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/comments/2959540/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/comments/2959949", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/commit/04007c23ce147a7ce1e9d6b2750ff5f37b0ddb60#commitcomment-2959949", "id": 2959949, "user": {"login": "mtdowling", "id": 190930, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/190930?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling", "html_url": "https://github.com/mtdowling", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "position": 236, "line": 236, "path": "src/Aws/S3/StreamWrapper.php", "commit_id": "04007c23ce147a7ce1e9d6b2750ff5f37b0ddb60", "created_at": "2013-04-07T00:39:59Z", "updated_at": "2013-04-07T00:39:59Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "Thanks for pointing this out.

Because of this, the client does not need to account for these types of data structures and you will need to format your data as needed before passing it to the client.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/comments/8495981/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/comments/8806152", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/commit/5cca0b150ec24dbb15f058a552ae96d62505958b#commitcomment-8806152", "id": 8806152, "user": {"login": "jeremeamia", "id": 107867, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/107867?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremeamia", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "position": null, "line": null, "path": null, "commit_id": "5cca0b150ec24dbb15f058a552ae96d62505958b", "created_at": "2014-12-02T22:57:40Z", "updated_at": "2014-12-02T22:57:40Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": ":shipit:\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/comments/8806152/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/comments/9093369", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/commit/ff1d0288eb541e3ac93a2333900daa1e67b8da2a#commitcomment-9093369", "id": 9093369, "user": {"login": "VyaoLucky", "id": 10300364, "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10300364?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/VyaoLucky", "html_url": "https://github.com/VyaoLucky", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VyaoLucky/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VyaoLucky/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VyaoLucky/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VyaoLucky/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VyaoLucky/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VyaoLucky/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VyaoLucky/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VyaoLucky/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VyaoLucky/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "position": 9, "line": 9, "path": "tests/Aws/Tests/S3/Integration/Sigv4Test.php", "commit_id": "ff1d0288eb541e3ac93a2333900daa1e67b8da2a", "created_at": "2014-12-26T03:21:32Z", "updated_at": "2014-12-26T03:21:32Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "1\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/comments/9093369/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/comments/9503893", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/commit/56a07f626a2fb784baeff4f29c5f106ab94dae82#commitcomment-9503893", "id": 9503893, "user": {"login": "mtdowling", "id": 190930, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/190930?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling", "html_url": "https://github.com/mtdowling", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "position": 15, "line": 15, "path": "src/DynamoDb/BinaryValue.php", "commit_id": "56a07f626a2fb784baeff4f29c5f106ab94dae82", "created_at": "2015-01-29T18:20:38Z", "updated_at": "2015-01-29T18:20:38Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "Note: Guzzle supports resources that are objects implementing __toString, iterators, and callables.
